<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It is believed that the Graded Literature Readers will commend
themselves to thoughtful teachers by their careful grading, their sound
methods, and the variety and literary character of their subject-matter.</p>

<p>They have been made not only in recognition of the growing discontent
with the selections in the older readers, but also with an appreciation
of the value of the educational features which many of those readers contained.
Their chief points of divergence from other new books, therefore,
are their choice of subject-matter and their conservatism in method.</p>

<p>A great consideration governing the choice of all the selections has
been that they shall interest children. The difficulty of learning to read
is minimized when the interest is aroused.</p>

<p>School readers, which supply almost the only reading of many children,
should stimulate a taste for good literature and awaken interest in
a wide range of subjects.</p>

<p>In the Graded Literature Readers good literature has been presented
as early as possible, and the classic tales and fables, to which constant
allusion is made in literature and daily life, are largely used.</p>

<p>Nature study has received due attention. The lessons on scientific subjects,
though necessarily simple at first, preserve always a strict accuracy.</p>

<p>The careful drawings of plants and animals, and the illustrations in
color&mdash;many of them photographs from nature&mdash;will be attractive to
the pupil and helpful in connection with nature study.</p>

<p>No expense has been spared to maintain a high standard in the illustrations,
and excellent engravings of masterpieces are given throughout
the series with a view to quickening appreciation of the best in art.</p>

<p>These books have been prepared with the hearty sympathy and very
practical assistance of many distinguished educators in different parts of
the country, including some of the most successful teachers of reading in
primary, intermediate, and advanced grades.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons and to President
Roosevelt for their courtesy in permitting the use of the selection from
"Hunting Trips of a Ranchman."</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In the Fourth and Fifth Readers the selections are longer,
the language more advanced, and the literature of a more
mature and less imaginative character than in the earlier
books.</p>

<p>The teacher should now place increased emphasis on the
literary side of the reading, pointing out beauties of language
and thought, and endeavoring to create an interest in the
books from which the selections are taken. Pupils will be
glad to know something about the lives of the authors whose
works they are reading, and will welcome the biographical
notes given at the head of the selections, and the longer
biographical sketches throughout the book. These can be
made the basis of further biographical study at the discretion
of the teacher.</p>

<p>Exercises and word lists at the end of the selections contain
all necessary explanations of the text, and also furnish
suggestive material for language work. For convenience,
the more difficult words, with definitions and complete
diacritical markings, are grouped together in the vocabulary
at the end of the book.</p>

<p>A basal series of readers can do little more than broadly
outline a course in reading, relying on the teacher to carry it
forward. If a public library is within reach, the children
should be encouraged to use it; if not, the school should
exert every effort to accumulate a library of standard works
to which the pupils may have ready access.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of a reading book is to give pupils
the mastery of the printed page, but through oral reading it
also becomes a source of valuable training of the vocal organs.
Almost every one finds pleasure in listening to good reading.
Many feel that the power to give this pleasure comes only as
a natural gift, but an analysis of the art shows that with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
practice any normal child may acquire it. The qualities
which are essential to good oral reading may be considered in
three groups:</p>

<p>First&mdash;An agreeable voice and clear articulation, which,
although possessed by many children naturally, may also be
cultivated.</p>

<p>Second&mdash;Correct inflection and emphasis, with that due
regard for rhetorical pauses which will appear whenever a
child fully understands what he is reading and is sufficiently
interested in it to lose his self-consciousness.</p>

<p>Third&mdash;Proper pronunciation, which can be acquired only
by association or by direct teaching.</p>

<p>Clear articulation implies accurate utterance of each syllable
and a distinct termination of one syllable before another
is begun.</p>

<p>Frequent drill on pronunciation and articulation before or
after the reading lesson will be found profitable in teaching
the proper pronunciation of new words and in overcoming
faulty habits of speech.</p>

<p>Attention should be called to the omission of unaccented
syllables in such words as <em>history</em> (not <em>histry</em>), <em>valuable</em> (not
<em>valuble</em>), and to the substitution of <em>unt</em> for <em>ent</em>, <em>id</em> for <em>ed</em>, <em>iss</em>
for <em>ess</em>, <em>unce</em> for <em>ence</em>, <em>in</em> for <em>ing</em>, in such words as <em>moment</em>,
<em>delighted</em>, <em>goodness</em>, <em>sentence</em>, <em>walking</em>. Pupils should also
learn to make such distinctions as appear between <em>u</em> long, as
in <em>duty</em>, and <em>u</em> after <em>r</em>, as in <em>rude</em>; between <em>a</em> as in <em>hat</em>, <em>a</em> as in
<em>far</em>, and <em>a</em> as in <em>ask</em>.</p>

<p>The above hints are suggestive only. The experienced
teacher will devise for herself exercises fitting special cases
which arise in her own work. It will be found that the best
results are secured when the interest of the class is sustained
and when the pupil who is reading aloud is made to feel that
it is his personal duty and privilege to arouse and hold this
interest by conveying to his fellow pupils, in an acceptable
manner, the thought presented on the printed page.</p>

<h2>The Straw, the Coal, and the Bean</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By the Brothers Grimm</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jakob Grimm (1785-1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (1786-1859):
German authors. The Brothers Grimm, as they are
familiarly called, wrote many learned scientific books, but
they are best known to children by their collection of German
fairy and folk stories.</p></div>


<p>1. In a village lived a poor old woman, who had
gathered some beans and wanted to cook them. So
she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn
more quickly, she lighted it with a handful of straw.</p>

<p>2. When she was emptying the beans into the
pan, one dropped without her observing it and lay
on the ground beside a straw. Soon afterwards a
burning coal from the fire leaped down to the two.</p>

<p>3. Then the straw said: "Dear friends, whence
do you come here?"</p>

<p>The coal replied: "I fortunately sprang out of
the fire. If I had not escaped by main force my
death would have been certain. I should have
been burned to ashes."</p>

<p>4. The bean said: "I, too, have escaped with a
whole skin. But if the old woman had got me into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the pan, I, like my comrades, should have been made
into broth without any mercy."</p>

<p>"And would a better fate have fallen to my
lot?" said the straw. "The old woman has destroyed
all my brethren in fire and smoke; she
seized sixty of them at once and took their lives.
I luckily slipped through her fingers."</p>

<p>5. "But what are we to do now?" asked the coal.</p>

<p>"I think," answered the bean, "that as we have so
fortunately escaped death, we should keep together
like good companions. Lest a new mischance should
overtake us here, let us go away to a foreign country."</p>

<p>6. This plan pleased the two others, and they set
out on their way together. Soon, however, they
came to a little brook, and, as there was no bridge,
they did not know how they were to get over.</p>

<p>At last the straw said: "I will lay myself across,
and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge."</p>

<p>7. The straw, therefore, stretched herself from one
bank to the other, and the coal, who was of an impetuous
nature, tripped forward quite boldly on the
newly built bridge. But when she reached the middle
and heard the water rushing beneath her, she
was, after all, frightened, and stood still.</p>

<p>8. The straw then began to burn, broke in two
pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped
after her, hissed when she sank into the water, and
breathed her last.</p>

</div>

<p>The bean, who had prudently stayed behind on
the shore, could not help laughing at these events,
and laughed so heartily that she burst.</p>

<p>9. It would have been all over with her also,
if, by good fortune, a tailor who was traveling in
search of work had not sat down to rest by the
brook. Pitying the poor bean, he pulled out his
needle and thread and sewed her together. She
thanked him prettily, but, as the tailor used black
thread, beans since then have a black seam.</p>

<h2>Robert Louis Stevenson</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 504px;">
<img src="images/illus015.jpg" width="504" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Robert Louis Stevenson</p></div>
</div>

<p>1. The famous Scotch author, Robert Louis Stevenson,
was born in Edinburgh, November 13, 1850.
He was a delicate child
with a sweet temper and
a happy, unselfish disposition,
who bore the
burden of ill health
bravely in childhood as
in later life. In "The
Land of Counterpane,"
a poem which you may
remember, he tells some
of the ways in which he
amused himself during
the idle days in bed.</p>

<p>2. When he was well
enough to be up, he
invented games for himself and took keen delight in
the world of outdoor life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>3. His education was carried on in a somewhat
irregular fashion. He attended schools in Edinburgh,
and studied with private tutors at places to
which his parents had gone for the benefit of his
health or of their own. He thus became an excellent
linguist, and gained wide knowledge of foreign
life and manners. He early showed a taste for literature,
beginning as a boy the careful choice of
language which made him a master of English prose.</p>

<p>4. Stevenson's father had planned to have him
follow the family profession of engineering. With
this in view he was sent to Edinburgh University
in the autumn of 1868. Later he gave up engineering
and attended law classes; but law, like engineering,
was put aside to enable him to fulfil his
strong desire for a literary life.</p>

<p>5. His first stories and essays, published in various
magazines, met with favorable notice. In 1878
he published his first book, "An Inland Voyage,"
the account of a canoe trip with a friend.</p>

<p>6. The mists and east winds of his native Scotland
proved too harsh for his delicate lungs, and
year after year he found it necessary to spend more
and more time away from his Edinburgh home.
On one of these journeys in quest of health, he
came to America, and in "Across the Plains" he
describes his journey in an emigrant train from
New York to San Francisco. It was on this visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to California that he met Mrs. Osbourne, who became
his wife in 1880.</p>

<p>7. "Treasure Island," a stirring tale of adventure,
was published in 1883. It was followed by two
other boys' stories, "The Black Arrow" and "Kidnapped."</p>

<p>8. In 1887 Stevenson and his wife again visited
America. They hired a yacht and spent two years
sailing among the islands of the South Seas, finally
visiting Apia in Samoa. Samoa pleased Stevenson,
and as the climate suited him, he decided to make
his home there. At Vailima, his Samoan home, he
spent four happy years with his wife and his mother.
Then his health failed, and he died suddenly, December
3, 1894. He was buried, as he had desired,
on the summit of a mountain near his home.</p>

<p>9. Besides many novels and volumes of essays,
Stevenson was the author of four volumes of poetry.
The best known of these is "A Child's Garden of
Verses," a book of delightful child poems from
which the poem "Travel" is taken.</p>

<h2>Travelers' Wonders</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Dr. John Aikin</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dr. John Aikin (1747-1822): The author of many scientific
and literary works. This selection is from "Evenings
at Home," a volume of stories for children written by Dr.
Aikin and his sister, Mrs. Barbauld. A hundred years ago,
there were few books written especially for young people,
except grammars, histories, and other text-books, and this
volume of instructive stories was very popular.</p></div>


<p>1. One winter evening Captain Compass was sitting
by the fireside with his children around him.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa," said little Jack, "do tell a story about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
what you have seen in your voyages. We have
been reading some wonderful tales of adventure.
As you have sailed round and round the world, you
must have seen many strange things."</p>

<p>2. "That I have, my son," said Captain Compass,
"and, if it will interest you, I will tell you some of
the curious things I have seen.</p>

<p>3. "Once about this time of the year I was in a
country where it was very cold. To keep warm, the
people had garments made from an animal's outer
covering which they stripped off his back while he
was yet alive. They also wore skins of beasts, these
skins being made smooth and soft in some way.</p>

<p>4. "Their homes were made of stones, of earth
hardened in the fire, or of the stalks of a large plant
which grew in that country. In the walls were holes
to let in the light; but to keep out the rain and the
cold air these holes were covered with a sort of
transparent stone, made of melted sand.</p>

<p>5. "They kept their homes warm by means of a
queer kind of rock which they had discovered in
the earth. This rock, when broken, burned and
gave out great heat."</p>

<p>6. "Dear me!" said Jack, "what wonderful rock!
I suppose it was somewhat like flints that give out
sparks when we knock them together."</p>

<p>"I don't think the flints would burn," said the
Captain; "besides, this was of a darker color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>7. "The food, too, of these people was strange.
They ate the flesh of certain animals, roots of plants,
and cakes made of powdered seeds. They often put
on these cakes a greasy matter which was the product
of a large animal.</p>

<p>"They ate, also, the leaves and other parts of a
number of plants, some quite raw, others prepared
in different ways by the aid of fire.</p>

<p>8. "For drink they liked water in which certain
dry leaves had been steeped. I was told that these
leaves came from a great distance.</p>

<p>"What astonished me most was the use of a drink
so hot that it seemed like liquid fire. I once got a
mouthful of it by mistake, taking it for water, and
it almost took away my breath. Indeed, people are
often killed by it; yet many of them are so foolish
that they will give for it anything they have.</p>

<p>9. "In warmer weather these people wore cloth
made from a sort of vegetable wool growing in pods
upon bushes. Sometimes they covered themselves
with a fine glossy stuff, which I was told was made
out of the webs of worms. Think of the great
number of worms required to make so large a quantity
of stuff as I saw used!</p>

<p>"The women especially wore very queer things.
Like most Indian nations, they wore feathers in their
headdress.</p>

<p>10. "I was also much surprised to see that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
brought up in their houses an animal of the tiger
kind, with sharp teeth and claws. In spite of its
natural fierceness this animal was played with and
caressed by timid women and children."</p>

<p>11. "I am sure I would not play with it," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"Why, you might get an ugly scratch if you did,"
said the Captain. "The speech of these people
seems very harsh to a stranger, yet they talk to one
another with great ease and quickness.</p>

<p>12. "One of their oddest customs is the way that
the men have of greeting the women. Let the
weather be what it will, they uncover their heads.
If they wish to seem very respectful, they stay
uncovered for some time."</p>

<p>13. "Why, that is like pulling off our hats," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah, papa!" cried Elizabeth, "I have found
you out. All this while you have been telling us
about our own country and what is done at home."</p>

<p>14. "But," said Jack, "we don't burn rock, nor
eat grease and powdered seeds, nor wear skins and
worms' webs, nor play with tigers."</p>

<p>15. "What is coal but rock?" asked the Captain,
"and is not butter grease; and corn, seeds; and
leather, skins; and silk, the web of a kind of worm?
And may we not as well call a cat an animal of the
tiger kind, as a tiger an animal of the cat kind?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>16. "If you remember what I have said, you will
find with your sister's help that all the other wonderful
things I have told you about are ones we
know quite well.</p>

<p>"I meant to show you that to a stranger our common
things might seem very wonderful. I also
wanted to show you that every day we call a great
many things by their names without ever thinking
about their nature; so it is really only their names
and not the things themselves that we know."</p>

<h2>Ants</h2>


<p>1. How often you have seen ants running about
the lawn, but have you ever stopped to watch them
and to study their habits? Let me tell you some
facts which have been learned about them. I am
sure they will give you a new interest in these wise
little creatures.</p>

<p>2. It may seem to you that ants run to and fro in
an aimless way; but this is not the case, for they
have work to do, and they are doing it with all their
might. They cannot see far before them, and it is
by means of their feelers, or perhaps by scent, that
they find their way.</p>

<p>3. You must remember that small weeds are to
them like huge trees, so we must look upon them
as travelers following a track through great forests.
You will see, too, that ants stop from time to time
to rest and to clean off the particles of earth which
cling to them.</p>

<p>4. Ants, like bees, do not enjoy living alone. In
their homes, which we call ant-hills, many thousands
of them live together. These homes are like great
cities; indeed, such places as London and New York
are the only human cities which compare with them
in size. There is never any disorder in these great
homes, although each ant is free to build, fight,
hunt, or go where it pleases.</p>

<p>5. If the top of an ant-hill be taken off, there will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
be found nurseries, chambers, halls, and kitchens&mdash;all
snug and waterproof.</p>

<p>6. In some countries ants build their houses above
ground and tunnel out great cellars under them.
But most of the ants we know make their homes
in the earth, where they can keep warmer than in
nests above ground.</p>

<p>7. Some ants tunnel out a home in the ground and
make a little hillock of earth around the top. At
night they close the entrances with leaves, bits of
straw, and tiny twigs. If you watch their nests in
the morning you see the busy little ants open their
doors and hurry out.</p>

<img src="images/illus027.jpg" width="700" height="331" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>An ant and its cow</p></div>
</div>

<p>8. Some hunt insects for food; some gather honey
from flowers; others milk their cows. These cows are
plant lice, which yield a
sweet juice of which ants
are very fond. So ants
keep herds of these little
insects. They keep
also beetles and other
insects as pets, or for use.</p>

<p>9. While some of the ants are getting food, those
at home are busy clearing out the galleries and
doing other work. The well-fed ants return to
the nests and share their food with the workers.
One of the ant laws is that each must help others
for the good of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>10. Deep down in the bottom of the nest lives the
queen ant, the mother of the family, who is very
much larger than the others. She does not take
care of her little ones. This is done by ant nurses,
who pick up the tiny eggs and care for them. In
the morning the eggs are carried up to the higher
chambers, which are warmed by the sun. In the
evening they are taken back to the lower rooms
away from the chill air.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 465px;">
<img src="images/illus028.jpg" width="465" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>An ant's nest</p></div>
</div>

<p>11. The eggs hatch into grubs, which look like
little grains of rice. These are the ant-babies. The
careful nurses feed
them, keep them warm
and clean, and carry
them from one room to
another, for babies, you
know, must be kept
comfortable. Think
how busy the nurses
must be with hundreds
and thousands of
babies to care for!</p>

<p>12. Some ants keep
slaves. Regular bands
of soldiers go out and
bring home the grubs of another kind of ant.
When these grow up they help their masters work.
Sometimes the masters depend so much on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
slaves that they will not build nests, care for their
young, nor even feed themselves. They become
so helpless that they die if their slaves are taken
from them.</p>

<p>13. Sometimes two ants will fight together until
both are killed. Sometimes armies of ants fight
together fiercely until one or the other party comes
off victor.</p>

<p>14. In cold countries ants sleep through the winter
deep down in their lower rooms. In warmer
countries they lay up stores in summer for the chilly
days when it would be hard for them to find food
in the meadows and fields.</p>

<p>15. In Texas there are ants which clear spaces ten
or twelve feet around their nests, only leaving the
needle grass or "ant rice," which they use for food.</p>

<p>16. Among other interesting species of ants are
the leaf-cutting ant, found in Central America, and
the honey ant of Mexico.</p>

<h2>Sifting Boys</h2>


<p>1. Not long ago I was looking over one of the
great saw-mills on the Mississippi River, in company
with the manager of the mill. As we came to one
room, he said: "I want you to notice the boys in
this room, and I will tell you about them afterwards."</p>

<p>2. There were some half-dozen boys at work on
saws, with different machines&mdash;some broadening the
points of the teeth, some sharpening them, some
deepening the notches between them. There was
one lad who stood leaning up against a bench, not
trying to do anything.</p>

<p>3. After we had passed out of the room, the manager
said: "That room is my sieve. The fine boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
go through that sieve to higher places and higher
pay. The coarse boys remain in the sieve and are
thrown out as of no use for this mill."</p>

<p>4. Then he explained what he meant. "If a boy
wants to work in the mill, I give him the job of
keeping the men in all parts of the mill supplied
with drinking-water. That is the lowest position
and draws the lowest pay. I say to that boy:
'When you have nothing else to do, go into this
room, and then I shall know where to find you when
I want you.'</p>

<p>5. "But there is a much more important reason
why I send him into this room. In a business like
this our men are constantly changing. A good deal
of the work, as you will see by watching the machines
and those who manage them, requires much attention
and skill. I must, therefore, look out for the
best men to put into the highest positions.</p>

<p>6. "Now, I put the water-boy into this room,
where there are several kinds of work being done.
There are pieces of broken saws lying about, and
some of the tools that are used in sharpening and
mending them.</p>

<p>7. "I watch that boy. If he begins handling the
broken saws, looking them over, trying them, practicing
on them with the tools there, watching the
other boys at their machines, asking questions about
how the work is done, and always making use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
his spare time in one way or another, why, that boy
is very soon promoted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus034.jpg" width="600" height="469" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Boys in the sieve</p></div>
</div>

<p>8. "He is first put to work on some of the machines
in this room, and afterwards on those that
require greater skill, and is pushed ahead as rapidly
as there are openings for him. He soon goes to a
better position and better pay, and I get a new
water-boy. He has gone through the sieve.</p>

<p>9. "But there is another kind of boy. When he
has time to spare, he spends it in doing nothing.
He leans up against the benches, crosses one leg over
the other, whistles, stares out of the window, no
doubt wishing he was outside, and watches the clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to see how soon he can get away. If he talks with
the other boys, it is not to ask questions about their
work, but to waste their time with some nonsense
or other.</p>

<p>10. "I often do all I can to help such a boy. I
push the tools under his very nose. I ask him questions
about them. I talk with him about his plans
for the future. I do all that I can to awaken some
kind of life in him. If the boy has any energy in
him, well and good; if he has not, he is simply useless.
I don't want such a boy in this mill even as
a water-boy."</p>

<h2>Lewis Carroll</h2>


<p>1. Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, an English author,
better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll,
was born January 27, 1832. His father was a clergyman,
and the home of Charles's boyhood was in
the country, some distance from the little village
of Daresbury. The neighborhood was so secluded
that even the passing of a cart was an interesting
event, but we may fancy that the home itself was
not a quiet one, since there were in it eleven boys
and girls.</p>

<p>2. Charles was a bright, merry boy who invented
games for the entertainment of his brothers and sisters,
and made pets of snails, toads, and other queer
animals. As a boy he seems to have lived in the
"Wonderland" which later he described for other
children. He enjoyed climbing trees, also, and other
boyish sports.</p>

<p>3. When Charles was eleven years old the family
moved to a Yorkshire village, and a year later
he was sent from home to school. Fond as he was
of play, he was fond of study, too, and his schoolmaster
found him a "gentle, intelligent, well-conducted
boy." After three years at Rugby, the most
famous of the English preparatory schools, Charles
Dodgson went to Oxford University. At Christ
Church, Oxford, as student, tutor, and lecturer, the
remainder of his life was spent. The routine of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
days was very simple and regular. He spent the
mornings in his lecture room, the afternoons in the
country or on the river, and the evenings with his
books, either reading or preparing for the next
day's work.</p>

<p>4. He was very fond of children and was a great
favorite with them, inventing puzzles, games, and
stories for their amusement. One July afternoon
in 1862, he took three little girls on a boating excursion,
and on the way he entertained them with a
wonderful story about the adventures of a little girl
named Alice. At the entreaty of his child friends,
Mr. Dodgson afterwards wrote out this story. It
was published with the title "Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland," under the pen name of Lewis Carroll.
It became at once a child-classic, being widely
read in England and America, and translated into
French, German, Italian, and other languages.</p>

<p>5. Mr. Dodgson wrote several other popular
books for children, the best known of which are
"Through the Looking-glass," a continuation of
Alice's adventures; "Sylvie and Bruno;" and
"The Hunting of the Snark." Besides these stories,
he wrote several learned works on mathematics. It
was hard for people to realize that Charles Dodgson,
the mathematician, and Lewis Carroll, the author
of the charming fairy tales, were one and the
same person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>6. After a short illness, Mr. Dodgson died January
14, 1898. "The world will think of Lewis Carroll
as one who opened out a new vein in literature&mdash;a
new and delightful vein&mdash;which added at once
mirth and refinement to life."</p>

<h2>What Alice Said to the Kitten</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Lewis Carroll</span></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. One thing was certain, that the <em>white</em> kitten
had had nothing to do with it; it was the black
kitten's fault entirely. For the white kitten had
been having its face washed by the old cat for the
last quarter of an hour, and bearing it pretty well,
considering; so you see that it <em>couldn't</em> have had
any hand in the mischief.</p>

<p>2. The way Dinah washed her children's faces
was this: First, she held the poor thing down by
its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw
she rubbed its face all over the wrong way, beginning
at the nose. Just now, as I said, she was hard
at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite
still and trying to pur&mdash;no doubt feeling that it
was all meant for its good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
<img src="images/illus041.jpg" width="474" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>From the painting by Angelica Kaufmann</p>

<p>Friends now, Pussy</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>3. But the black kitten had been finished with
earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was
sitting curled up in a corner of the great armchair,
half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten
had been having a grand game of romps with the
ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up,
and had been rolling it up and down till it had all
come undone again. There it was, spread over the
hearthrug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten
running after its own tail in the middle.</p>

<p>4. "Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!" cried
Alice, catching up the kitten and giving it a little
kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.
"Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better
manners! You <em>ought</em>, Dinah; you know you
ought!" she added, looking reproachfully at the old
cat and speaking in as cross a voice as she could
manage. Then she scrambled back into the armchair,
taking the kitten and the worsted with her,
and began winding up the ball again.</p>

<p>5. But she didn't get on very fast, as she was
talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and
sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on
her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the
winding, and now and then putting out one paw
and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad
to help if it might.</p>

<p>6. "Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?"
Alice began. "You'd have guessed if you'd been
up in the window with me&mdash;only Dinah was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
making you tidy, so you couldn't. I was watching
the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire&mdash;and it
wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold
and it snowed so they had to leave off. Never
mind, Kitty; we'll go and see the bonfire to-morrow."</p>

<p>7. Here Alice wound two or three turns of the
worsted round the kitten's neck, just to see how it
would look. This led to a scramble, in which the
ball rolled down upon the floor and yards and yards
of it got unwound again.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>8. "Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty," Alice
went on as soon as they were comfortably settled
again, "when I saw all the mischief you had been
doing, I was very near opening the window and
putting you out into the snow! And you'd have
deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What
have you got to say for yourself?</p>

<p>9. "Now, don't interrupt me!" she went on, holding
up one finger; "I'm going to tell you all your
faults. Number one: You squeaked twice while
Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now,
you can't deny it, Kitty; I heard you! What's that
you say?"&mdash;pretending that the kitten was speaking&mdash;"Her
paw went into your eye? Well, that's
<em>your</em> fault for keeping your eyes open. If you'd
shut them tight up it wouldn't have happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>10. "Now, don't make any more excuses, but
listen. Number two: You pulled Snowdrop away
by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of
milk before her! What! you were thirsty, were
you? How do you know she wasn't thirsty, too?
Now for number three: You unwound every bit of
the worsted while I wasn't looking.</p>

<p>11. "That's three faults, Kitty, and you've not
been punished for any of them yet. You know I
am saving up all your punishments for Wednesday
week. Suppose they had saved up all <em>my</em> punishments,"
she went on, talking more to herself than to
the kitten, "what <em>would</em> they do at the end of a
year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when
the day came.</p>

<p>12. "Or&mdash;let me see&mdash;suppose each punishment
was to be going without a dinner? Then, when the
miserable day came, I should have to go without
fifty dinners at once. Well, I shouldn't mind <em>that</em>
much. I'd far rather go without them than eat them.</p>

<p>13. "Do you hear the snow against the window
panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just
as if some one was kissing the window all over outside.
I wonder if the snow <em>loves</em> the trees and
fields that it kisses them so gently? And then it
covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt;
and perhaps it says, 'Go to sleep, darlings, till the
summer comes again.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>14. "And when they wake up in the summer,
Kitty, they dress themselves all in green and dance
about whenever the wind blows&mdash;oh, that's very
pretty!" cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted
to clap her hands: "And I do so <em>wish</em> it were true."</p>

<h2>The Snow-Image</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864): An American novelist.
His best works are "The Scarlet Letter," "The House of the
Seven Gables," and "The Marble Faun." Hawthorne wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
also several delightful books for children; among these are
"Grandfather's Chair," a collection of stories from New
England history, "Biographical Stories," "The Wonder
Book," and "Tanglewood Tales"&mdash;the two latter being
volumes of stories from Greek mythology.</p></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. One afternoon of a cold winter's day, when the
sun shone forth with chilly brightness, after a long
storm, two children asked leave of their mother to
run out and play in the new-fallen snow.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus048.jpg" width="700" height="689" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Forth sallied the two children.</p></div>
</div>

<p>2. The elder child was a little girl, whom, because
she was of a tender and modest
disposition, and was thought to
be very beautiful, her parents
and other people, who were
familiar with her, used to call
Violet.</p>

<p>3. But her brother was
known by the title of Peony, on
account of the ruddiness of his
broad and round little phiz,
which made everybody think
of sunshine and great scarlet flowers.</p>

<p>"Yes, Violet&mdash;yes, my little Peony," said their
kind mother; "you may go out and play in the new
snow."</p>

<p>4. Forth sallied the two children, with a hop-skip-and-jump
that carried them at once into the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
heart of a huge snowdrift, whence Violet emerged
like a snow bunting, while little Peony floundered
out with his round face in full bloom.</p>

<p>5. Then what a merry time had they! To look
at them frolicking in the wintry garden, you would
have thought that the dark and pitiless storm had
been sent for no other purpose but to provide a
new plaything for Violet and Peony; and that they
themselves had been created, as the snowbirds were,
to take delight only in the tempest and in the white
mantle which it spread over the earth.</p>

<p>6. At last, when they had frosted one another all
over with handfuls of snow, Violet, after laughing
heartily at little Peony's figure, was struck with a
new idea.</p>

<p>"You look exactly like a snow-image, Peony,"
said she, "if your cheeks were not so red. And
that puts me in mind! Let us make an image out
of snow&mdash;an image of a little girl&mdash;and it shall be
our sister and shall run about and play with us all
winter long. Won't it be nice?"</p>

<p>7. "Oh, yes!" cried Peony, as plainly as he could
speak, for he was but a little boy. "That will be
nice! And mamma shall see it!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Violet; "mamma shall see the
new little girl. But she must not make her come
into the warm parlor, for, you know, our little snow-sister
will not love the warmth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>8. And forthwith the children began this great
business of making a snow-image that should run
about; while their mother, who was sitting at the
window and overheard some of their talk, could not
help smiling at the gravity with which they set
about it. They really seemed to imagine that there
would be no difficulty whatever in creating a live
little girl out of the snow.</p>

<p>9. Indeed, it was an exceedingly pleasant sight&mdash;those
bright little souls at their tasks! Moreover, it
was really wonderful to observe how knowingly and
skillfully they managed the matter. Violet assumed
the chief direction and told Peony what to do, while,
with her own delicate fingers, she shaped out all the
nicer parts of the snow-figure.</p>

<p>10. It seemed, in fact, not so much to be made by
the children, as to grow up under their hands, while
they were playing and prattling about it. Their
mother was quite surprised at this; and the longer
she looked, the more and more surprised she grew.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>11. Now, for a few moments, there was a busy
and earnest but indistinct hum of the two children's
voices, as Violet and Peony wrought together with
one happy consent. Violet still seemed to be the
guiding spirit; while Peony acted rather as a
laborer and brought her the snow from far and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
near. And yet the little urchin evidently had a
proper understanding of the matter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/illus051.jpg" width="410" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Violet and Peony wrought together.</p></div>
</div>

<p>12. "Peony, Peony!" cried Violet; for her brother
was at the other side of the garden. "Bring me
those light wreaths of snow that have rested on the
lower branches of the
pear tree. You can
clamber on the snowdrift,
Peony, and reach
them easily. I must
have them to make some
ringlets for our snow-sister's
head!"</p>

<p>13. "Here they are,
Violet!" answered the
little boy. "Take care
you do not break them.
Well done! Well done!
How pretty!"</p>

<p>"Does she not look
sweet?" said Violet, with a very satisfied tone;
"and now we must have some little shining bits of
ice to make the brightness of her eyes. She is not
finished yet. Mamma will see how very beautiful
she is; but papa will say, 'Tush! nonsense!&mdash;come
in out of the cold!'"</p>

<p>14. "Let us call mamma to look out," said Peony;
and then he shouted, "Mamma! mamma!! mam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>ma!!!
Look out and see what a nice 'ittle girl we
are making!"</p>

<p>15. "What a nice playmate she will be for us all
winter long!" said Violet. "I hope papa will not
be afraid of her giving us a cold! Shan't you love
her dearly, Peony?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried Peony. "And I will hug her
and she shall sit down close by me and drink some
of my warm milk."</p>

<p>16. "Oh! no, Peony!" answered Violet, with grave
wisdom. "That will not do at all. Warm milk
will not be wholesome for our little snow-sister.
Little snow-people, like her, eat nothing but icicles.
No, no, Peony; we must not give her anything warm
to drink!"</p>

<p>17. There was a minute or two of silence; for
Peony, whose short legs were never weary, had gone
again to the other side of the garden. All of a sudden,
Violet cried out; loudly and joyfully:</p>

<p>18. "Look here, Peony! Come quickly! A
light has been shining on her cheek out of that rose-colored
cloud! And the color does not go away!
Is not that beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is beau-ti-ful," answered Peony, pronouncing
the three syllables with deliberate accuracy.
"O Violet, only look at her hair! It is all
like gold!"</p>

<p>19. "Oh, certainly," said Violet, as if it were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
much a matter of course. "That color, you know,
comes from the golden clouds that we see up there
in the sky. She is almost finished now. But her
lips must be made very red&mdash;redder than her
cheeks. Perhaps, Peony, it
will make them red if we
both kiss them!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 686px;">
<img src="images/illus053.jpg" width="686" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"Kiss me!" cried Peony.</p></div>
</div>

<p>20. Accordingly, the mother
heard two smart little
smacks, as if both her children
were kissing the snow-image
on its frozen mouth.
But as this did not seem
to make the lips quite red
enough, Violet next proposed
that the snow-child should be invited to kiss
Peony's scarlet cheek.</p>

<p>21. "Come, 'ittle snow-sister, kiss me!" cried
Peony.</p>

<p>"There! she has kissed you," added Violet, "and
now her lips are very red. And she blushed a
little, too!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a cold kiss!" cried Peony.</p>

<p>22. Just then there came a breeze of the pure west
wind sweeping through the garden and rattling the
parlor windows. It sounded so wintry cold that
the mother was about to tap on the window pane
with her thimbled finger to summon the two chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>dren
in, when they both cried out to her with one
voice:</p>

<p>23. "Mamma! mamma! We have finished our little
snow-sister, and she is running about the garden
with us!"</p>

<p>24. "What imaginative little beings my children
are!" thought the mother, putting the last few
stitches into Peony's frock. "And it is strange, too,
that they make me almost as much a child as they
themselves are! I can hardly help believing now
that the snow-image has really come to life!"</p>

<p>"Dear mamma!" cried Violet, "pray look out
and see what a sweet playmate we have!"</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>25. The mother, being thus entreated, could no
longer delay to look forth from the window. The
sun was now gone out of the sky, leaving, however,
a rich inheritance of his brightness among those
purple and golden clouds which make the sunsets
of winter so magnificent.</p>

<p>26. But there was not the slightest gleam or
dazzle, either on the window or on the snow; so
that the good lady could look all over the garden
and see everything and everybody in it. And what
do you think she saw there? Violet and Peony, of
course, her own two darling children.</p>

<p>27. Ah, but whom or what did she see besides?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Why, if you will believe me, there was a small figure
of a girl, dressed all in white, with rose-tinged
cheeks and ringlets of golden hue, playing about
the garden with the two children!</p>

<p>28. A stranger though she was, the child seemed
to be on as familiar terms with Violet and Peony,
and they with her, as if all the three had been
playmates during the whole of their little lives.
The mother thought to herself that it must certainly
be the daughter of one of the neighbors, and
that, seeing Violet and Peony in the garden, the
child had run across the street to play with them.</p>

<p>29. So this kind lady went to the door, intending
to invite the little runaway into her comfortable
parlor; for, now that the sunshine was withdrawn,
the atmosphere out of doors was already growing
very cold.</p>

<p>30. But, after opening the house door, she stood
an instant on the threshold, hesitating whether she
ought to ask the child to come in, or whether she
should even speak to her. Indeed, she almost
doubted whether it were a real child after all, or
only a light wreath of the new-fallen snow, blown
hither and thither about the garden by the intensely
cold west wind.</p>

<p>31. There was certainly something very singular
in the aspect of the little stranger. Among all the
children of the neighborhood the lady could remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>ber
no such face, with its pure white and delicate
rose-color, and the golden ringlets tossing about the
forehead and cheeks.</p>

<p>32. And as for her dress, which was entirely of
white, and fluttering in the breeze, it was such as
no reasonable woman would put upon a little girl
when sending her out to play in the depth of winter.
It made this kind and careful mother shiver
only to look at those small feet, with nothing in the
world on them except a very thin pair of white
slippers.</p>

<p>33. Nevertheless, airily as she was clad, the child
seemed to feel not the slightest inconvenience from
the cold, but danced so lightly over the snow that
the tips of her toes left hardly a print in its surface;
while Violet could but just keep pace with her, and
Peony's short legs compelled him to lag behind.</p>

<p>34. All this while, the mother stood on the threshold,
wondering how a little girl could look so much
like a flying snowdrift, or how a snowdrift could
look so very like a little girl.</p>

<p>She called Violet and whispered to her.</p>

<p>"Violet, my darling, what is this child's name?"
asked she. "Does she live near us?"</p>

<p>35. "Why, dearest mamma," answered Violet,
laughing to think that her mother did not comprehend
so very plain an affair, "this is our little snow-sister
whom we have just been making!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dear mamma," cried Peony, running to his
mother and looking up simply into her face. "This
is our snow-image! Is it not a nice 'ittle child?"</p>

<p>36. "Violet," said her mother, greatly perplexed,
"tell me the truth without any jest. Who is this
little girl?"</p>

<p>"My darling mamma," answered Violet, looking
seriously into her mother's face," surprised that she
should need any further explanation, "I have told
you truly who she is. It is our little snow-image
which Peony and I have been making. Peony will
tell you so, as well as I."</p>

<p>37. "Yes, mamma," asseverated Peony, with much
gravity in his crimson little phiz; "this is 'ittle
snow-child. Is not she a nice one? But, mamma,
her hand is, oh, so very cold!"</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>38. While mamma still hesitated what to think
and what to do, the street gate was thrown open
and the father of Violet and Peony appeared,
wrapped in a pilot-cloth sack, with a fur cap drawn
down over his ears, and the thickest of gloves upon
his hands.</p>

<p>39. Mr. Lindsey was a middle-aged man, with a
weary and yet a happy look in his wind-flushed and
frost-pinched face, as if he had been busy all the
day long and was glad to get back to his quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
home. His eyes brightened at the sight of his wife
and children, although he could not help uttering a
word or two of surprise at finding the whole family
in the open air on so bleak a day, and after sunset,
too.</p>

<p>40. He soon perceived the little white stranger,
sporting to and fro in the garden like a dancing
snow-wreath, and the flock of snowbirds fluttering
about her head.</p>

<p>"Pray, what little girl may that be?" inquired
this very sensible man. "Surely her mother must
be crazy to let her go out in such bitter weather
as it has been to-day, with only that flimsy white
gown and those thin slippers!"</p>

<p>41. "My dear husband," said his wife, "I know
no more about the little thing than you do. Some
neighbor's child, I suppose. Our Violet and Peony,"
she added, laughing at herself for repeating so absurd
a story, "insist that she is nothing but a snow-image
which they have been busy about in the
garden almost all the afternoon."</p>

<p>42. As she said this, the mother glanced her eyes
toward the spot where the children's snow-image
had been made. What was her surprise on perceiving
that there was not the slightest trace of
so much labor!&mdash;no image at all!&mdash;no piled-up heap
of snow!&mdash;nothing whatever save the prints of little
footsteps around a vacant space!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>43. "This is very strange!" said she.</p>

<p>"What is strange, dear mother?" asked Violet.
"Dear father, do not you see how it is? This is
our snow-image, which Peony and I have made because
we wanted another playmate. Did not we,
Peony?"</p>

<p>"Yes, papa," said crimson Peony. "This be our
'ittle snow-sister. Is she not beau-ti-ful? But she
gave me such a cold kiss!"</p>

<p>44. "Poh, nonsense, children!" cried their good,
honest father, who had an exceedingly common-sensible
way of looking at matters. "Do not tell
me of making live figures out of snow. Come, wife;
this little stranger must not stay out in the bleak air
a moment longer. We will bring her into the parlor;
and you shall give her a supper of warm bread
and milk, and make her as comfortable as you can."</p>

<p>45. So saying, this honest and very kindhearted
man was going toward the little white damsel,
with the best intentions in the world. But Violet
and Peony, each seizing their father by the hand,
earnestly besought him not to make her come in.</p>

<p>46. "Nonsense, children, nonsense, nonsense!"
cried the father, half-vexed, half-laughing. "Run
into the house, this moment! It is too late to play
any longer now. I must take care of this little
girl immediately, or she will catch her death-a-cold!"</p>

<p>And so, with a most benevolent smile, this very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
well-meaning gentleman took the snow-child by
the hand and led her toward the house.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 631px;">
<img src="images/illus060.jpg" width="631" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>He took the snow-child by the hand.</p></div>
</div>

<p>47. She followed him,
droopingly and reluctant,
for all the glow
and sparkle were gone
out of her figure; and
whereas just before she
had resembled a bright,
frosty, star-gemmed
evening, with a crimson
gleam on the cold
horizon, she now
looked as dull and languid as a thaw.</p>

<p>48. As kind Mr. Lindsey led her up the steps of
the door, Violet and Peony looked into his face,
their eyes full of tears, which froze before they
could run down their cheeks, and entreated him
not to bring their snow-image into the house.</p>

<p>49. "Not bring her in!" exclaimed the kindhearted
man. "Why, you are crazy, my little Violet&mdash;quite
crazy, my small Peony! She is so cold
already that her hand has almost frozen mine, in
spite of my thick gloves. Would you have her
freeze to death?"</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>50. His wife, as he came up the steps, had been
taking another long, earnest gaze at the little white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
stranger. She hardly knew whether it was a dream
or no; but she could not help fancying that she
saw the delicate print of Violet's fingers on the
child's neck. It looked just as if, while Violet was
shaping out the image, she had given it a gentle pat
with her hand, and had neglected to smooth the
impression quite away.</p>

<p>51. "After all, husband," said the mother, "after
all, she does look strangely like a snow-image! I
do believe she is made of snow!"</p>

<p>A puff of the west wind blew against the snow-child,
and again she sparkled like a star.</p>

<p>52. "Snow!" repeated good Mr. Lindsey, drawing
the reluctant guest over his hospitable threshold.
"No wonder she looks like snow. She is
half frozen, poor little thing! But a good fire will
put everything to rights."</p>

<p>53. The common-sensible man placed the snow-child
on the hearthrug, right in front of the hissing
and fuming stove.</p>

<p>"Now she will be comfortable!" cried Mr. Lindsey,
rubbing his hands and looking about him, with
the pleasantest smile you ever saw. "Make yourself
at home, my child."</p>

<p>54. Sad, sad and drooping looked the little white
maiden as she stood on the hearthrug, with the
hot blast of the stove striking through her like a
pestilence. Once she threw a glance toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
window, and caught a glimpse, through its red curtains,
of the snow-covered roofs and the stars glimmering
frostily and all the delicious intensity of the
cold night. The bleak wind rattled the window
panes as if it were summoning her to come forth.
But there stood the snow-child, drooping, before the
hot stove!</p>

<p>55. But the common-sensible man saw nothing
amiss.</p>

<p>"Come, wife," said he, "let her have a pair of
thick stockings and a woolen shawl or blanket
directly; and tell Dora to give her some warm
supper as soon as the milk boils. You, Violet and
Peony, amuse your little friend. She is out of spirits,
you see, at finding herself in a strange place.
For my part, I will go around among the neighbors
and find out where she belongs."</p>

<p>56. The mother, meanwhile, had gone in search of
the shawl and stockings. Without heeding the
remonstrances of his two children, who still kept
murmuring that their little snow-sister did not love
the warmth, good Mr. Lindsey took his departure,
shutting the parlor door carefully behind him.</p>

<p>57. Turning up the collar of his sack over his ears,
he emerged from the house, and had barely reached
the street-gate when he was recalled by the screams
of Violet and Peony and the rapping of a thimbled
finger against the parlor window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>58. "Husband! husband!" cried his wife, showing
her horror-stricken face through the window
panes. "There is no need of going for the child's
parents!"</p>

<p>"We told you so, father!" screamed Violet and
Peony, as he re&euml;ntered the parlor. "You would
bring her in; and now our poor&mdash;dear&mdash;beau-ti-ful
little snow-sister is thawed!"</p>

<p>59. And their own sweet little faces were already
dissolved in tears; so that their father, seeing what
strange things occasionally happen in this everyday
world, felt not a little anxious lest his children
might be going to thaw, too. In the utmost perplexity,
he demanded an explanation of his wife.</p>

<p>60. She could only reply that, being summoned to
the parlor by the cries of Violet and Peony, she
found no trace of the little white maiden, unless it
were the remains of a heap of snow which, while she
was gazing at it, melted quite away upon the hearthrug.</p>

<p>"And there you see all that is left of it!"
added she, pointing to a pool of water in front of
the stove.</p>

<p>61. "Yes, father," said Violet, looking reproachfully
at him through her tears, "there is all that is
left of our dear little snow-sister!"</p>

<p>"Naughty father!" cried Peony, stamping his
foot, and&mdash;I shudder to say&mdash;shaking his little fist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
at the common-sensible man. "We told you how it
would be. What for did you bring her in?"</p>

<p>62. And the stove, through the isinglass of its
door, seemed to glare at good Mr. Lindsey, like a
red-eyed demon triumphing in the mischief which
it had done!</p>

<h2>The House I Live In</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. This wonderful body of mine is the house in
which I live. This house has five gates, through
which messages from the outside world can get to
me. There is Eye Gate, Ear Gate, Nose Gate, Taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Gate, and Touch Gate. All my knowledge of the
things around me comes in through these five gates.</p>

<p>2. This house of mine has, in its lower story, a
kitchen called the stomach. Here the food is cooked,
or "digested," as we say, and prepared for being
mixed with the blood. In the story above there is a
great pump, the heart, which sends the blood through
the house to keep it warm and in good repair.</p>

<p>Then, in the top story, or the head, is the room
where the master or mistress of the house lives.</p>

<p>3. We should learn all we can about this house
and what to do to keep it in good order. We should
find out what is bad for it and what is good, that
we may avoid the one and seek the other. Thus we
may hope to grow up strong and healthy men and
women. Good health will cheer us and make all
our work easy and pleasant.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/illus066.jpg" width="509" height="642" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A section of skin</p></div>
</div>

<p>4. The first lesson on health
that I have to learn is this: <em>I
must keep my body clean</em>. Much
of the dirt that gathers on the
body comes, not from the outside,
but from the inside of the body.
The skin is full of little pores.
These pores are the mouths of
tiny pipes, or tubes, millions of which are found in
the skin.</p>

<p>5. You can see them in this picture, which shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
a little bit of the skin, cut through from the inside
to the outside and very much enlarged.</p>

<p>It is through these tubes that the body rids itself
of many waste substances which would prove very
harmful if retained. When their outlets become
choked up with dirt, nothing can pass through them.
You see, therefore, how necessary it is to keep the
skin clean if we wish to have good health.</p>

<p>6. Once upon a time a great man was coming to
visit a certain town. The people went out to meet
him, clad in gay and curious dresses so as to do
honor to their noble visitor. One little boy was
covered all over with thin leaves of gold, so that
he might look like a golden boy.</p>

<p>7. No doubt he looked very pretty, but he became
ill and died before the gilding could be removed
All the pores of his skin were closed up by the gold;
and it soon caused his death.</p>

<p>8. In Holland there is a village which is said to
be the cleanest in the world. The houses, inside
and outside, the streets, and everything about the
place, are kept neat as a pin. Women wearing
clumsy wooden shoes may be seen scrubbing the
houses and pavements.</p>

<p>9. We should be like these Dutch people and keep
our wonderful house, the body, clean. It is only by
frequently washing the whole body that we can
keep in good health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/illus068.jpg" width="550" height="386" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The cleanest village in the world</p></div>
</div>

<p>Water and soap are all that are needed to keep
the skin clean and ready for its work, and every one
can get these.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>10. The second health lesson I have to learn is
this: <em>I must breathe fresh air</em>. If a man cannot
get air to breathe, he will die. But that is not
all: impure air is bad for him.</p>

<p>11. Why do we need to breathe at all?</p>

<p>Because the air contains a gas called oxygen, and
a constant supply of this gas must be taken into the
blood, or else we cannot remain in good health.
When we breathe, the air passes down into the
lungs and there meets with the blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>12. And as the oxygen gas passes inwards, another
gas, which has to be got rid of, passes outwards and
is breathed out into the air. Thus the air we breathe
out is different from the air we breathe in. It has
lost the gas which is necessary for our life and
health, and it contains a gas which is hurtful to us.</p>

<p>13. If I live in a room that does not get fresh air,
the air in it will soon become close and bad, because
every time I breathe I take some of the oxygen out
of it and put injurious gas in its place.</p>

<p>14. If a small animal, such as a bird or a rabbit, is
put under a glass bell so that no air can get in, it
uses up all the oxygen. In a few minutes it becomes
faint; it is unable to stand up, and unless it gets
fresh air it will soon die.</p>

<p>15. You may have heard the story of the Black
Hole of Calcutta. One hundred and forty-six English
prisoners were shut up in a small cell. They
could not get enough fresh air to breathe, and in
the morning one hundred and twenty-three of them
were found dead.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>16. The third health lesson I have to learn is this:
<em>I must take plenty of exercise</em>. To make the body
strong we must use it. The parts that are most
used become the strongest, and those used least will
be the weakest.</p>

<p>17. The arms of the blacksmith are very strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
because he uses them so much. The boy who works
and plays in the open air grows strong and healthy,
but the boy who sits indoors and does not take
exercise often grows up to be a weak and unhealthy
man. It is best to take our exercise in the open air
and the sunlight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/illus070.jpg" width="550" height="386" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The king and the dervish</p></div>
</div>

<p>18. Games like baseball are good for boys. There
are also plenty of pleasant outdoor games for girls.
When no game can be played, a brisk walk in the
open air is quite as good. Brisk walking is one of
the easiest and best of exercises for both boys and
girls.</p>

<p>19. But there are some things we should avoid
when taking exercise. We should not work or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
play too long without resting. We should not try
to do things that are beyond our strength. When
exercise is too violent, it does harm rather than good.</p>

<p>20. An eastern king, who had become pale and
ill, asked a wise dervish what medicine he should
take.</p>

<p>The dervish, knowing that it was exercise alone
which the idle king needed, said: "I will bring you
to-morrow a remedy which will cure your disease."</p>

<p>21. The next day the dervish appeared before the
king.</p>

<p>"Here," said he, "is a ball which holds the medicine
that will cure you. Take it into your garden
every day and knock it about till you perspire
freely. This will make the medicine take effect."</p>

<p>The king did as the dervish told him, and the
exercise in the fresh air soon made him well.</p>

<p>Ball, door, sun, cold, church, odor, milk, bitterness, bell,

<p>Never trouble another for what you can do yourself.</p>

<p>Never spend your money before you have earned

<p>Pride costs more than hunger, thirst, and cold.</p>

<p>We seldom repent of having eaten too little.</p>

<h2>The Story of Florinda</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Abby Morton Diaz</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mrs. Abby Morton Diaz (1821&mdash;): An American author
who married a Cuban gentleman. She has written many
popular books for the young: among these are "The William
Henry Letters," "William Henry and his Friends," "Polly
Cologne," and "The Cat's Arabian Nights."</p></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. Nathaniel Bowen came over from England with
his family in the bark "Jasper" more than two
hundred years ago. The country was covered with
woods then. Indians, buffaloes, deer, wolves, and
foxes had it pretty much to themselves.</p>

<p>2. Mr. Bowen built a one-roomed hut in a clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>ing
in the woods. Its walls and ceiling were made
of logs; there were square holes for windows, with
wooden shutters inside. One of the windows had
four small panes of glass brought from England; the
others were covered with oiled paper. At one end
of the room was a large stone chimney; at the other
a ladder ran up into the loft above. The hut was
furnished with a bed, a great chest, a spinning
wheel, a bench or two, and a few chairs.</p>

<p>3. There was one house besides Mr. Bowen's in
the valley, and only one, and that belonged to a
man named Moore. It stood nearly an eighth of
a mile off.</p>

<p>Four miles off, at the Point, there were some dozen
or twenty houses, a store, and a mill. There was no
road to the Point; there was only a blind pathway
through the woods. Those woods reached hundreds
and hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>4. When Mr. Bowen had lived in this country a
little more than a year, his wife died, leaving three
children&mdash;Philip, not quite eleven years old; Nathaniel,
six; and Polly, three. To take care of these
children and to keep his house, he hired a young girl
named Florinda Le Shore, who had come over from
England as a servant in some family. This Florinda
was born in France, but she had spent the greater
part of her life in England. She was only fifteen
years old&mdash;rather young to take the care of a family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Florinda went to Mr. Bowen's house some time
in November. On the 29th of December, as Mr.
Bowen and Mr. Moore were saddling their horses to
go to the store for provisions, word came that they
must set out immediately for a place about fifteen
miles off, called Dermott's Crossing, to consult with
other settlers as to what should be done to defend
themselves against the Indians; for there were reports
that in some neighborhoods the Indians were
doing mischief.</p>

<p>6. So the two men turned their horses' heads in
the direction of Dermott's Crossing. It was woods
most of the way, but they knew the general direction
of the bridle path and thought they should
make good time and be back by noon of the next day.</p>

<p>7. Florinda baked corn meal into thin cakes, and
put the cakes and some slices of bacon into the saddlebags
along with corn for the horse. The men were
to return by way of the store and bring provisions.</p>

<p>8. Two days and two nights passed, and they had
neither come nor sent any message. By that time
there was not much left to eat in either house.</p>

<p>Florinda and the children slept both nights at
Mrs. Moore's. Mr. Bowen had said it would be better
for them to sleep there.</p>

<p>9. He did not fear any actual danger (the Indians
in this neighborhood had never been troublesome at
all); still, in case anything should happen, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Moore's house was much the safer of the two. It
was built of heavy timbers, and its doors were of
oak, studded with spikes.</p>

<p>10. The Indians never attacked a strong house like
that, especially if it were guarded by a white man
with firearms.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moore's brother was living with her&mdash;a
young man named David Palmer, who could not
walk then on account of having frozen his feet.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>11. On the second morning Philip begged Florinda
to let him take his hand sled and go to the
store and get some meal and some bacon for themselves
and Mrs. Moore. Florinda felt lo&#257;th to let
him go. It was a long distance; there was snow in
the woods and no track.</p>

<p>12. But Philip said that he wasn't afraid: the oldest
boy ought to take care of the family.</p>

<p>And at last Florinda said he might go. Indeed,
there seemed no other way; for, unless he did, they
might all starve, especially if there should come on
a heavy snowstorm.</p>

<p>13. Mrs. Moore had him start from her house, because
she wanted to be sure he was well wrapped
up. He left home in good spirits about nine o'clock
in the morning on the thirty-first day of December,
promising to be back before evening.</p>

<p>14. Florinda spent the day in spinning and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
other work for the family. As soon as it began to
grow dark, she barred the door and shut all
the window shutters but one. She left that open so
that Philip might see the firelight
shining through.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 412px;">
<img src="images/illus081.jpg" width="412" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>She set him letters to copy.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The children began to cry
because Philip was out all
alone in the dark woods, and
Florinda did everything she
could to occupy their minds.</p>

<p>15. Nathaniel told afterward
of her rolling up the
cradle quilt into a baby for
little Polly and pinning an
apron on it; and of her setting
him letters to copy on the
bellows with chalk. He said
she tied a strip of cloth round
his head to keep the hair out
of his eyes when he bent over
to make the letters. He remembered her stopping
her wheel very often to listen for Philip.</p>

<p>16. At last little Polly fell asleep and was placed
on the bed. Nathaniel laid his head on Florinda's
lap and dropped asleep there, and slept till she got
up to put more wood on. It was then nearly twelve
o'clock. He woke in a fright, and crying. He had
been dreaming about wolves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>17. After a while Nathaniel climbed up and looked
through a knot-hole in the door and told Florinda
he saw a fire in the woods.</p>

<p>Florinda said she thought not, that maybe it was
the moon rising; and kept on with her spinning.</p>

<p>18. By and by he looked again, and said he did
see a fire and some Indians sitting down by it.</p>

<p>Florinda left her wheel then and looked through,
and said yes, it was so.</p>

<p>19. She kept watch afterward and saw them put
out the fire and go away into the woods toward the
Point. She told Nathaniel of this, and then held
him in her arms and sang songs, low, in a language
he could not understand. By this time the night
was far spent.</p>

<p>20. At the side of the hut, near the fireplace, there
had been in the summer a hole or tunnel dug
through to the outside under the logs. It was begun
by a tame rabbit that belonged to Nathaniel.
The rabbit burrowed out and got away.</p>

<p>21. The children at play dug the hole deeper and
wider, and it came quite handy in getting in fire-wood.
This passage was about four feet deep.
They called it the <em>back doorway</em>. When winter
came on, it was filled up with sand and moss.</p>

<p>22. Florinda thought it well to be prepared for
anything which might happen; and, therefore, she
spent the latter part of that night in taking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
filling from the <em>back doorway</em>. The outer part was
frozen hard and had to be thawed with hot water.</p>

<p>When this was done, she took the workbag out
of her clothes box and put into it Mr. Bowen's
papers and the teaspoons.</p>

<p>23. She said a great deal to Nathaniel about taking
care of little Polly; told him that if any bad
Indians came to the door, he must catch hold of her
hand and run just as quickly as he could through
the <em>back doorway</em> to Mrs. Moore's.</p>

<p>24. While she was talking to Nathaniel in the
way I have said, they heard a step outside. It was
then a little after daybreak.</p>

<p>Some one tapped at the door, and a strange voice
said: "A friend; open, quick!"</p>

<p>25. She opened the door and found a white man
standing there. This white man told her that unfriendly
Indians were prowling about to rob, to
kill, and to burn dwelling houses, and that several
were known to be in that very neighborhood. The
man was a messenger sent to warn people. He
could not stop a moment.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>26. As soon as the man had gone, Florinda double-barred
the door, raked ashes over the fire, put on
her things and the children's things, and got ready
to go with them over to Mrs. Moore's. She made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
up several bundles, gave one to each of the children,
and took one herself.</p>

<p>27. But, before starting, she opened the shutter a
crack and looked out; and there she saw two Indians
coming toward the door. She flung down her
bundle, snatched the children's away from them,
hung the workbag round Nathaniel's neck, whispering
to him: "Run, run! you'll have time; I'll keep
them out till you get away!" all the while pulling
at the clothes chest.</p>

<p>28. He heard the Indians yell, and saw Florinda
brace herself against the door with her feet on the
chest.</p>

<p>"Run, run!" she kept saying. "Take care of little
Polly! don't let go of little Polly!"</p>

<p>29. Nathaniel ran with little Polly; and on the
way they met the young man, David Palmer, creeping
along with his gun. He had got the news and
had come to tell Florinda to hurry away. Just at
that moment he heard the yells of the Indians and
the sound of their clubs beating in the door.</p>

<p>30. He threw the gun down and went on just as
fast as a man could in such a condition, and presently
saw two Indians start from the house and run
into the woods. He listened a moment and heard
dogs barking; then crept round the corner of the
house. The door had been cut away.</p>

<p>31. Florinda lay across the chest, dead, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
thought; and, indeed, she was almost gone. They
had beaten her on the head with a hatchet or a
club. One blow more and Florinda would never
have breathed again.</p>

<p>David Palmer did everything he could do to
make her show some signs of life; and was so intent
upon this that he paid no attention to the
barking of the dogs, and did not notice that it was
growing louder and coming nearer every moment.</p>

<p>32. Happening to glance toward the door, he saw
a man on horseback, riding very slowly toward the
house, leading another horse with his right hand,
and with his left drawing something heavy on a
sled. The man on horseback was Mr. Moore. He
was leading Mr. Bowen's horse with his right hand,
and with the other he was dragging Mr. Bowen on
Philip's hand sled.</p>

<p>33. Coming home from Dermott's Crossing, Mr.
Bowen was taken sick and had to travel at a very
slow pace. When they had almost reached home,
they found Philip's sled among the bushes.</p>

<p>34. Philip himself had left the sled there. The
day that he went to the Point, he had to wait for
corn to be ground, which made him late in starting
home. He heard a good many reports concerning
the Indians, and thought that, instead of keeping in
his own tracks, it would be safer to take a roundabout
course back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>35. By doing this, he lost his way and wandered
in the woods till almost twelve o'clock at night,
when he came out upon a cleared place where there
were several log huts. The people in one of these
let him come in and sleep on the floor, and they
gave him a good meal of meat and potatoes. He
set out again between four and five in the morning,
guided by a row of stars that those people pointed
out to him.</p>

<p>36. A little after daybreak, being then about a
quarter of a mile from home, in a hilly place, he
thought he would leave his sled, as the load
was so hard to draw, and run ahead and tell the
folks about the Indians. So he pushed it under
some bushes; and then, to mark the spot, he took
one of his shoe strings and tied one of his mittens
high up on the limb of a tree.</p>

<p>37. Just as he came to the brook, he heard some
strange sounds, and climbed up into a hemlock tree,
which overhung the brook, to hide and to look about.
He lay along a branch listening, and presently saw
Nathaniel, with the workbag around his neck,
hurrying toward the brook, leading little Polly.</p>

<p>38. Philip was just going to call out, when he
caught sight of three Indians standing behind some
trees on the other side watching the two children.
Little Polly was afraid to step on the ice. Philip
moved a little to see better, and by doing this lost
sight of them a moment; and, when he looked
again, they were both gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/illus087.jpg" width="383" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Indians watching the two children.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a><br /><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>39. He heard a crackling in the bushes and caught
sight of little Polly's blanket flying through the
woods, and knew then that those Indians had
carried off Nathaniel and little Polly. Without
stopping to consider, he jumped down and followed
on, thinking, as he afterward said, to find out where
they went and tell his father.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>40. Philip, by one way or another, kept on the
trail of those Indians the whole day. Once it was
by finding the stick that little Polly dropped;
once it was by coming across a butcher knife the
Indians had stolen from some house: and he had
wit enough to break a limb or gash a tree now and
then, so as to find his way back; also to take the
bearings of the hills. When the Indians halted to
rest, he had a chance to rest, too.</p>

<p>41. At last they stopped for the night in a sheltered
valley where there were two or three wigwams.
He watched them go into one of these, and then
he could not think what to do next. The night was
setting in bitter cold. The shoe he took the string
from had come off in his running, and that foot
was nearly frozen, and would have been quite if
he had not tied some moss to the bottom of it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
his pocket handkerchief. The hand that had no
mitten was frozen. He had eaten nothing but a
few boxberry plums and boxberry leaves.</p>

<p>42. It was too late to think of finding his way
home that night. He lay down on the snow; and,
as the Indians lifted the mats to pass in and out,
he could see fires burning and smell meats cooking.</p>

<p>43. Then he began to feel sleepy, and after
that knew nothing more till he woke inside a
wigwam, and found two Indian women rubbing
him with snow. They afterward gave him plenty
to eat.</p>

<p>He did not see Nathaniel and little Polly; they
were in another wigwam.</p>

<p>44. There were two Indians squatting on the floor,
one of them quite old. Pretty soon another came
in; and Philip knew he was one of those that
carried off the children, because he had Florinda's
workbag hanging around his neck. He thought,
no doubt, from seeing it on Nathaniel's neck, that
there was the place to wear it.</p>

<p>45. Philip suffered dreadful pain in his foot and
hand, but shut his mouth tight for fear he might
groan. He said afterward, when questioned about
this part of his story, that he was not going to let
them hear a white boy groan.</p>

<p>46. Now, the older one of those two squaws in the
wigwam felt inclined to save Philip. So next morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>ing,
before light, when the Indians all had gone
off hunting, she sent the other squaw out on some
errand, and then told Philip, in broken English and
by signs, that he must run away that very morning.
She bound up his foot; she
gave him a moccasin to wear
on it; she gave him a bag of
pounded corn and a few
strips of meat.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 457px;">
<img src="images/illus091.jpg" width="457" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>She gave him a bag of corn.</p></div>
</div>

<p>47. Philip had found out
that the Indians supposed
him to be a captive escaped
from another party; and he
thought it would be better
not to mention Nathaniel
and little Polly, but to get
home as quickly as he could
and tell people where they
were.</p>

<p>48. When the young squaw
came in, the old one set her at work parching corn,
with her back to the door; then made signs to Philip,
and he crept out and ran. After running a few rods,
he came unexpectedly upon a wigwam. There was
a noise of some one pounding corn inside; and
when that stopped he stopped, and when that went
on he went on, and so crept by.</p>

<p>49. As soon as it began to grow light, he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
along without much trouble, partly by means of the
signs on the trees. As he got farther on, there being
fewer of these signs (because they had come so
swiftly that part of the way), he took the wrong
course&mdash;very luckily, as it proved; for by doing so
he fell in with two men on horseback, and one of
these carried him home.</p>

<p>50. Philip described the place where the children
were, and that very night a party was sent out
which captured the Indians and brought back
Nathaniel and little Polly.</p>

<h2>Tilly's Christmas</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Louisa M. Alcott</span></p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888): One of the most popular
of American writers of juvenile literature. She was the
author of twenty-eight volumes, including, among others,
"Little Women," "Little Men," "The Old-Fashioned
Girl," and "Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag," from which the present
story is taken.</p></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. "I'm so glad to-morrow is Christmas, because
I'm going to have lots of presents."</p>

<p>"So am I glad, though I don't expect any presents
but a pair of mittens."</p>

<p>"And so am I; but I shan't have any presents
at all."</p>

<p>2. As the three little girls trudged home from
school they said these things, and as Tilly spoke
both the others looked at her with pity and some
surprise, for she spoke cheerfully, and they wondered
how she could be happy when she was so poor.</p>

<p>3. "Don't you wish you could find a purse full of
money right here in the path?" said Kate, the child
who was going to have "lots of presents."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I, if I could keep it honestly!" and
Tilly's eyes shone at the very thought.</p>

<p>4. "What would you buy?" asked Bessy, rubbing
her cold hands, and longing for her mittens.</p>

<p>"I'd buy a pair of large, warm blankets, a load of
wood, a shawl for mother, and a pair of shoes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
me, and, if there were enough left, I'd give Bessy a
new hat, and then she needn't wear Ben's old felt
one," answered Tilly.</p>

<p>5. The girls laughed at that; but Bessy pulled
the funny hat over her ears, and said she was much
obliged, but she'd rather have candy.</p>

<p>6. "Let's look, and maybe we can find a purse.
People are always going about with money at Christmas
time, and some one may lose it here," said Kate.</p>

<p>So, as they went along the snowy road, they
looked about them, half in earnest, half in fun.
Suddenly Tilly sprang forward, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see it! I've found it!"</p>

<p>7. The others followed, but all stopped disappointed,
for it wasn't a purse; it was only a little
bird. It lay upon the snow with its wings spread
and feebly fluttering, as if too weak to fly. Its little
feet were benumbed with cold; its once bright eyes
were dull with pain, and instead of a blithe song, it
could only utter a faint chirp now and then, as if
crying for help.</p>

<p>8. "Nothing but a stupid old robin; how provoking!"
cried Kate, sitting down to rest.</p>

<p>"I shan't touch it. I found one once, and took
care of it, and the ungrateful thing flew away the
minute it was well," said Bessy, creeping under
Kate's shawl and putting her hands under her chin
to warm them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>9. "Poor little birdie! How pitiful he looks, and
how glad he must be to see some one coming to
help him! I'll take him up gently and carry him
home to mother. Don't be frightened, dear, I'm
your friend;" and Tilly knelt down in the snow,
stretching her hand to the bird with the tenderest
pity in her face.</p>

<p>10. Kate and Bessy laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't stop for that thing; it's getting late and
cold; let's go on and look for the purse," they said,
moving away.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't leave it to die," cried Tilly. "I'd
rather have the bird than the money, so I shan't
look any more. The purse wouldn't be mine, and I
should only be tempted to keep it; but this poor
thing will thank and love me, and I'm so glad I
came in time."</p>

<p>11. Gently lifting the bird, Tilly felt its tiny, cold
claws cling to her hand, and saw its dim eyes
brighten as it nestled down with a grateful chirp.</p>

<p>"Now I have a Christmas present, after all," she
said, smiling, as they walked on. "I always wanted
a bird, and this one will be such a pretty pet
for me."</p>

<p>12. "He'll fly away the first chance he gets, and
die anyhow; so you'd better not waste your time
over him," said Bessy.</p>

<p>"He can't pay you for taking care of him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
my mother says it isn't worth while to help folks
that can't help us," added Kate.</p>

<p>13. "My mother says, 'Do as you'd be done by;'
and I'm sure I'd like any one to help me if I was
dying of cold and hunger. 'Love your neighbor as
yourself,' is another of her sayings. This bird is
my little neighbor, and I'll love him and care for
him, as I often wish our rich neighbor would love
and care for us," answered Tilly, breathing her
warm breath over the benumbed bird, who looked
up at her with confiding eyes, quick to feel and
know a friend.</p>

<p>14. "What a funny girl you are," said Kate; "caring
for that silly bird, and talking about loving
your neighbor in that sober way. Mr. King doesn't
care a bit for you, and never will, though he knows
how poor you are; so I don't think your plan
amounts to much."</p>

<p>15. "I believe it, though; and shall do my part,
anyway. Good night. I hope you'll have a merry
Christmas, and lots of pretty things," answered
Tilly, as they parted.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>16. Her eyes were full, and she felt so poor as she
went on alone toward the little, old house where she
lived. It would have been so pleasant to know
that she was going to have some of the pretty
things all children love to find in their full stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>ings
on Christmas morning. And pleasanter still to
have been able to give her mother something nice.
So many comforts were needed, and there was no
hope of getting them; for they could barely get
food and fire.</p>

<p>17. "Never mind, birdie; we'll make the best of
what we have and be merry in spite of everything.
You shall have a happy Christmas, anyway; and I
know God won't forget us, if every one else does."</p>

<p>She stopped a minute to wipe her eyes and lean
her cheek against the bird's soft breast, finding
great comfort in the little creature, though it could
only love her, nothing more.</p>

<p>18. "See, mother, what a nice present I've found,"
she cried, going in with a cheery face that was like
sunshine in a dark room.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that, dearie; for I haven't been able
to get my little girl anything but a rosy apple. Poor
bird! Give it some of your warm bread and milk."</p>

<p>19. "Why, mother, what a big bowlful! I'm
afraid you gave me all the milk," said Tilly, smiling
over the nice, steaming supper that stood ready
for her.</p>

<p>"I've had plenty, dear. Sit down and dry your
wet feet, and put the bird in my basket on this
warm flannel."</p>

<p>20. Tilly peeped into the closet and saw nothing
there but dry bread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother's given me all the milk, and is going
without her tea 'cause she knows I'm hungry.
Now I'll surprise her, and she shall have a good
supper, too. She is going to split wood, and I'll
fix it while she's gone."</p>

<p>21. So Tilly put down the old teapot, carefully
poured out a part of the milk, and from her pocket
produced a great, plummy bun that one of the
school children had given her and she had saved for
her mother. A slice of the dry bread was nicely
toasted, and the bit of butter set by for her put
on it. When her mother came in, there was the
table drawn up in a warm place, a hot cup of tea
ready, and Tilly and birdie waiting for her.</p>

<p>22. Such a poor little supper, and yet such a
happy one; for love, charity, and contentment were
guests there, and that Christmas eve was a blither
one than that up at the great house, where lights
shone, fires blazed, a great tree glittered, and music
sounded, as the children danced and played.</p>

<p>23. "We must go to bed early, for we've only
wood enough to last over to-morrow. I shall be
paid for my work the day after, and then we can get
some," said Tilly's mother, as they sat by the fire.</p>

<p>24. "If my bird was only a fairy bird, and would
give us three wishes, how nice it would be! Poor
dear, he can't give me anything; but it's no matter,"
answered Tilly, looking at the robin, which lay in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
basket with his head under his wing, a mere little
feathery bunch.</p>

<p>25. "He can give you one thing, Tilly&mdash;the pleasure
of doing good. That is one of the sweetest
things in life; and the poor can enjoy it as well as
the rich."</p>

<p>26. As her mother spoke, with her tired hand
softly stroking her little daughter's hair, Tilly suddenly
started and pointed to the window, saying in
a frightened whisper:</p>

<p>"I saw a face&mdash;a man's face, looking in! It's gone
now; but I truly saw it."</p>

<p>27. "Some traveler attracted by the light, perhaps.
I'll go and see." And Tilly's mother went
to the door.</p>

<p>No one was there. The wind blew cold, the stars
shone, the snow lay white on field and wood, and
the Christmas moon was glittering in the sky.</p>

<p>28. "What sort of face was it?" asked Tilly's
mother, coming back.</p>

<p>"A pleasant sort of face, I think; but I was so
startled I don't quite know what it was like. I
wish we had a curtain there," said Tilly.</p>

<p>29. "I like to have our light shine out in the
evening, for the road is dark and lonely just here,

eyes as they go by. We can do so little for our
neighbors, I am glad to cheer the way for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Now put these poor old shoes to dry, and go to
bed, dearie; I'll come soon."</p>

<p>30. Tilly went, taking her bird with her to sleep
in his basket near by, lest he should be lonely
in the night.</p>

<p>Soon the little house was dark and still, and no
one saw the Christmas spirits at their work that
night.</p>

<p>31. When Tilly opened the door next morning,
she gave a loud cry, clapped her hands, and then
stood still, quite speechless with wonder and delight.
There, before the door, lay a great pile of
wood all ready to burn, a big bundle, and a basket,
with a lovely nosegay of winter roses, holly, and
evergreen tied to the handle.</p>

<p>32. "Oh, mother! did the fairies do it?" cried
Tilly, pale with her happiness, as she seized the
basket, while her mother took in the bundle.</p>

<p>33. "Yes, dear, the best and dearest fairy in the
world, called 'Charity.' She walks abroad at
Christmas time, does beautiful deeds like this, and
does not stay to be thanked," answered her mother
with full eyes, as she undid the parcel.</p>

<p>34. There they were&mdash;the warm, thick blankets,
the comfortable shawl, the new shoes, and, best of
all, a pretty winter hat for Bessy. The basket
was full of good things to eat, and on the flowers
lay a paper saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"For the little girl who loves her neighbor as
herself."</p>

<p>35. "Mother, I really think my bird is a fairy
bird, and all these splendid things come from him,"
said Tilly, laughing and crying with joy.</p>

<p>36. It really did seem so, for, as she spoke, the
robin flew to the table, hopped to the nosegay, and,
perching among the roses, began to chirp with all
his little might. The sun streamed in on flowers,
bird, and happy child, and no one saw a shadow
glide away from the window; no one ever knew
that Mr. King had seen and heard the little girls
the night before, or dreamed that the rich neighbor
had learned a lesson from the poor neighbor.</p>

<p>37. And Tilly's bird was a fairy bird; for by
her love and tenderness to the helpless thing she
brought good gifts to herself, happiness to the unknown
giver of them, and a faithful little friend
who did not fly away, but stayed with her till the
snow was gone, making summer for her in the
winter time.</p>

<h2>Our First Naval Hero</h2>


<p>1. Much has been said about the gallant deeds of
the brave sailors who won the victories of Manila
and Santiago in the war with Spain.</p>

<p>The great steel war ships of to-day are very different
from the small wooden vessels with which
the naval battles of the Revolution were fought.</p>

<p>2. But we had brave sailors in those early days,
also, as you can learn from the following stories of
our first great naval hero. This hero's name was
John Paul Jones.</p>

<p>3. At the beginning of the Revolution, Jones
offered his services to Congress, and was given a
position in the navy. He showed such skill and
courage that he was soon put in command of a ship.</p>

<p>When a ship was being fitted out for him, he
asked for a good one. "For," said he, "I intend to
go in harm's way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Paul Jones was the first to raise the stars and
stripes on the seas, and he soon made his flag feared
by the enemies of his country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/illus105.jpg" width="452" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Jones rowed to his own vessel.</p></div>
</div>

<p>5. Not long after he raised his flag, he went to
Whitehaven, on the coast of England. There
hundreds of English vessels lay at anchor. At
midnight, Jones, with two small boats, rowed noiselessly
into the harbor. Leaving the others to set
fire to the English ships, he
hastened forward, with only
one man, to take the fort
which defended the harbor.</p>

<p>6. He spiked every gun
and then hurried back to
his men. What was his
rage to find that they had
not set fire to the ships as
he had ordered.</p>

<p>7. By this time day was
beginning to break, and the
people of the town were
gathering at the water-side. But Paul Jones was
unwilling to see his plan fail entirely. All alone he
entered a large ship, and set fire to it with his
own hands.</p>

<p>8. As the flames rose high, the people rushed
forward to put them out. But Paul Jones, pistol
in hand, threatened to shoot down the first man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
who should approach. When the ship was fairly
on fire, he rowed to his own vessel and sailed out of
the harbor.</p>

<p>9. Through the help of Franklin, Jones obtained
command of a vessel which he called the "Poor
Richard." As it and three other small American
ships were sailing along the English coast, they
saw a fleet of merchant vessels accompanied by two
large war ships.</p>

<p>10. Jones at once gave chase. The merchant vessels
scattered like wild pigeons, and ran for shore,
but the two war ships advanced to fight.</p>

<p>Paul Jones, in his old, half worn-out ship, fearlessly
approached the Serapis, a new vessel with an
excellent crew. Both vessels opened fire, and two
of Jones's guns burst at once.</p>

<p>11. Soon the vessels drew close together, and
Jones gave orders to board the Serapis. His
men were driven back, and Captain Pearson of the
Serapis called to know, if he had yielded.</p>

<p>"I have not yet begun to fight," replied Jones.</p>

<p>12. The ships parted, and the size and strength of
the enemy told against the Poor Richard, so Jones
determined to try again to board the Serapis. As
the two vessels came close to each other, Jones
ordered them to be fastened together.</p>

<p>13. Captain Pearson did not like this close fighting,
for it took away all the advantage his better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
ship and heavier guns had given him. Paul Jones's
guns now touched those of the Serapis. As the
gunners loaded, they had to thrust their ramrods
into the enemy's ports. Never before had an
English commander met such a foe or fought such
a battle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus107.jpg" width="600" height="410" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Jones himself helped work the guns.</p></div>
</div>

<p>14. With his heaviest guns useless, and part of his
deck blown up, Jones still kept up the unequal
fight. He himself helped work the guns. In this
hour of need one of the American vessels, the Alliance,
commanded by a Frenchman, came up, and instead
of attacking the Serapis, fired on the Poor
Richard.</p>

<p>15. Just then the gunners and carpenter ran up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
saying that the ship was sinking. Captain Pearson
called again to know if the ship had yielded. Paul
Jones replied that if he could do no better he
would go down with his colors flying.</p>

<p>16. In the confusion the English prisoners had
been set free. One of them, who passed through
the fire to his own ship, told Captain Pearson that
the Poor Richard was sinking; if he could hold out
but a few minutes longer she must go down.</p>

<p>17. Imagine the condition of Paul Jones at this
moment! Every gun was silenced, except the one
at which he himself stood; his ship was gradually
settling beneath him, a hundred prisoners swarmed
on his decks, and the Alliance was firing on his
ship. Still he would not yield. He ordered the
prisoners to the pumps, declaring that if they would
not work they should sink with him.</p>

<p>18. The condition of the Serapis was little better
than that of the Poor Richard. Both vessels looked
like wrecks, and both were on fire. The Serapis
was at last forced to surrender. Nothing but Paul
Jones's courage and his resolve never to give up
had saved him from defeat.</p>

<p>19. The captain of the Alliance had intended to
destroy Jones's ship, and then take the English vessel
and claim the honor of the victory. He was
disgraced for his conduct, and Jones was honored,
as he deserved to be.</p>

<p>20. Captain Pearson was made a knight for the
courage with which he defended his ship.</p>

<p>When Jones heard this, he said: "Well, he
deserved it; and if I have the good fortune to fall
in with him again, I will make him a lord."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882): One of the
most popular of American poets. "Evangeline" and "Hiawatha"
are the best known of his longer poems. Among
his shorter poems are many household favorites, such as
"The Village Blacksmith," "Excelsior," and "The Psalm
of Life." Longfellow was also the author of two prose volumes,
"Outre Mer" and "Hyperion," descriptive of his
European travels.</p></div>

<span class="i0">"Take my cloak, O Hiawatha!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With his knife the tree he girdled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just beneath its lowest branches,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Just above the roots, he cut it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the sap came oozing outward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the trunk, from top to bottom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheer he cleft the bark asunder,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Down he hewed boughs of cedar,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Said, with one long sigh of sorrow,<br /></span>

<h2>Shun Delay</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. One day an old farmer went into the nearest
market town with some of the produce of his farm.
When he had attended to all his business, he stabled
his horse at the inn and went to see the great
lawyer who lived in one of the grandest
houses in the town.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 551px;">
<img src="images/illus116.jpg" width="551" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"What is the matter?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>2. He rang the bell and sent in word
that he wished to see the
lawyer on important business.</p>

<p>On being shown into the
room, he said: "Now, sir,
I have come to get your advice."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the
lawyer; "what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"That is for you to find out,"
said the old man. "I have come to
you to get advice, not to give it."</p>

<p>3. The lawyer had never before met so queer a
client. No one was in the habit of speaking so
bluntly to him. He was rather amused than angry,
and made up his mind to find out what the old
man really wanted with him.</p>

<p>So he asked: "Have you a complaint to make
against any one?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said the farmer; "I live at peace with all
my neighbors."</p>

<p>4. "Perhaps you wish to recover a debt?"</p>

<p>"No!" shouted the old man; "I owe no man;
and, if any one owes me anything, he gets time to
pay it. There are honest people in the part I
come from."</p>

<p>5. The lawyer asked several other questions, but
without being able to discover why his strange
client had called upon him. At length he said that
he was unable to give him any advice, as he did not
seem to be in any difficulty or trouble.</p>

<p>6. "Difficulty or trouble!" said the old man;
"that's exactly what I am in. I come to ask you
for advice&mdash;you, the greatest lawyer in the country&mdash;and
you can do nothing to help me. That's difficulty
and trouble enough, I think.</p>

<p>7. "Many of my friends and neighbors have been
to see lawyers from time to time, and taken their
advice about the conduct of their affairs. They say
they have done well ever since. So when I came to
market to-day, I made up my mind to come to you
and get advice; but, as you have none to give me,
I must go to some other man who understands
my case."</p>

<p>8. "You need not do that," said the lawyer.
"Now that you have explained, I understand your
case thoroughly. Your neighbors have been receiv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>ing
legal advice, and you do not wish to be considered
less important than they."</p>

<p>9. "That's it," shouted the man, delighted that he
was understood at last.</p>

<p>The lawyer gravely took a sheet of paper and a
pen. Then he asked the man his name.</p>

<p>10. "John Brown," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Occupation?"</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked, in amazement.</p>

<p>"What do you do for a living?"</p>

<p>"Oh! is that what occupation means?" he said.
"I'm a farmer."</p>

<p>11. The great lawyer wrote it all down, and added
something which the farmer could not make out.
Then, folding the paper, he gave it to the old man,
who paid his fee, and went out delighted that he
was now every bit as clever as his neighbors.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>12. When he arrived home, he found a number of
his work people at his door, talking to his wife.</p>

<p>"Ah, here comes John," she cried; "he will tell
us what to do."</p>

<p>13. Then she explained to her husband that the
hay was all cut and ready for carrying in, and the
men wanted to know whether they should stop for
the night, or work till the fields were clear. The
weather had been fine for many days, and the sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
had a settled appearance, so that there seemed no
need of haste for fear of rain.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus119.jpg" width="500" height="397" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>He found a number of his work people.</p></div>
</div>

<p>14. The farmer thought a moment without coming
to any decision. Suddenly he remembered the
lawyer's advice which he had in his pocket.</p>

<p>"This will decide it in a minute," he cried, as he
unfolded the paper. "I have here an opinion from
one of our famous lawyers, and we will follow whatever
advice he gives. Read it," he said to his wife.
"You are a better scholar than I."</p>

<p>15. His wife took the paper and read aloud:
"John Brown, farmer. Do not put off till to-morrow
what you can do to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"A famous opinion," cried the farmer with delight.
"Away to the fields, lads, and get the
hay in."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/illus120.jpg" width="355" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>His wife read aloud.</p></div>
</div>

<p>16. The men went back and worked with a will.
In the moonlight they kept busy loading the carts,
till, at length, all the fields were cleared.
As the last load was driven in, a few
drops of rain began to fall, but there
was no sign of a storm.</p>

<p>17. During the night, however, a tempest
of wind and rain burst over the
valley, and when the farmer got up in
the morning, several of his fields were
flooded. We can well imagine how
thankful he was that he had not put off
his work till to-morrow. Had he done
so, he would have found, as so many have found,
that to-morrow is too late.</p>

<p>18. "A famous piece of advice that was," he remarked,
as he walked back to the house. "'Do not
put off till to-morrow what you can do to-day.' If
everybody acted on that plan, what a world of misery
and disappointment would be saved. I will always
do so for the future."</p>

<p>19. The farmer kept his word, and he found, as
you wall also find if you try it, that his work was
lighter, and that the world went more smoothly
than it had ever done before.</p>

<h2>The Story of Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Peribanou</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">From "The Arabian Nights"</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The exact origin of these famous Eastern tales is uncertain.
They were first made known to English readers about two
hundred years ago, and they have ever since maintained a
foremost place in the affections of children.</p></div>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. There was a sultan who had three sons and
a niece. The eldest of the princes was called
Houssain; and the second, Ali; and the youngest,
Ahmed; and the princess, his niece, Nouronnihar.</p>

<p>2. The Princess Nouronnihar was the orphan
daughter of the sultan's younger brother. The sultan
brought his niece up in his palace with the three
princes, proposing to marry her, when she arrived at
a proper age, to some neighboring prince. But
when he perceived that the three princes, his sons,
all loved her, he was very much concerned. As
he was not able to decide among them, he sent all
three to travel in distant countries, promising his
niece in marriage to the one who should bring him
as a gift the greatest curiosity.</p>

<p>3. The princes accordingly set out disguised as
merchants. They went the first day's journey together,
and, as they parted, they agreed to travel for
a year and to meet again at a certain inn. The
first that came should wait for the rest; so that, as
they had all three taken leave together of the sul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>tan,
they might all return together. By break of
day they mounted their horses and set forth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus127.jpg" width="650" height="482" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>They mounted their horses and set forth.</p></div>
</div>

<p>4. Prince Houssain, the eldest brother, went to
the kingdom of Bisnagar. Here, by good fortune,
he found a wonderful carpet. It was ordinary in
appearance, but had this singular property: whoever
seated himself on it was at once transported
to any place he might wish.</p>

<p>5. Prince Ali, the second brother, joined a caravan
and journeyed to the capital of the kingdom of
Persia. There he procured from a merchant an
ivory tube which would reveal to any one looking
through it whatever he wished to see.</p>

<p>6. Prince Ahmed took the road to Samarkand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
He also bought what he considered the greatest
possible curiosity. This was an artificial apple, the
smell of which would cure a person of the most
deadly disease.</p>

<p>7. At the appointed time the princes met at the
inn. They showed one another their treasures, and
immediately saw through the tube that the princess
was dying. They then sat down on the carpet,
wished themselves with her, and were there in a
moment.</p>

<p>8. As soon as Prince Ahmed was in Nouronnihar's
chamber, he rose from the carpet, and going
to the bedside put the apple under her nose.
The princess immediately opened her eyes, and
turned her head from one side to another, looking
at the persons who stood about her; then she rose
up in bed and asked to be dressed, just as if she
had waked out of a sound sleep.</p>

<p>9. The princes then went to throw themselves at
the feet of the sultan, their father, and to pay their
respects to him. But when they came before him,
they found he had been informed of their arrival
and by what means the princess had been cured.
The sultan received them with the greatest joy.</p>

<p>10. After the usual ceremonies and compliments,
the princes presented their curiosities: Prince
Houssain his carpet, Prince Ali his ivory tube, and
Prince Ahmed his artificial apple; and after each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
had commended his present, they begged the sultan
to declare to which of them he would give the
Princess Nouronnihar for a wife, according to his
promise.</p>

<p>11. The sultan, having heard all that the princes
could say about their gifts, remained some time
silent. At last he said: "I would declare for one
of you, my children, with a great deal of pleasure if
I could do it with justice. But the gift of no one
of you alone would have been sufficient to cure the
princess; Ahmed's apple would have been of no
use if Ali's tube had not first revealed her illness,
and Houssain's carpet transported you to her side.
Therefore, as neither carpet, tube, nor apple can be
preferred one before the other, I cannot grant the
princess to any one of you.</p>

<p>12. "I must use other means to make my choice.
Get each of you a bow and arrow, and go to the
great plain where they exercise the horses. I will
give the princess to him who shoots the farthest."</p>

<p>13. The three princes had nothing to say against
the decision of the sultan. Each provided himself
with a bow and arrow, and went to the plain, followed
by a great crowd of people.</p>

<p>14. Prince Houssain, as the eldest, took his bow
and arrow, and shot first; Prince Ali shot next, and
much beyond him; and Prince Ahmed last of all,
but nobody could see where his arrow fell; and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
spite of all the care that was used by himself and
everybody else in searching, it was not to be found
far or near.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/illus130.jpg" width="550" height="478" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Prince Ahmed shot last of all.</p></div>
</div>

<p>15. Though it was believed that Prince Ahmed
shot the farthest, and that he, therefore, deserved
the Princess Nouronnihar, it was necessary that his
arrow should be found, to make the matter certain.
So the sultan judged in favor of Prince Ali, and the
wedding took place soon after.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>16. Prince Houssain would not honor the feast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
with his presence. In short, such was his grief that
he left the court and became a hermit.</p>

<p>17. Prince Ahmed, too, did not go to the wedding;
but he did not renounce the world, as Houssain had
done. As he could not imagine what had become
of his arrow, he stole away from his attendants to
search for it. He went to the place where the other
arrows had been found, going straight forward from
there and looking carefully on both sides of him.</p>

<p>18. He went on till he came to some steep, craggy
rocks, which were situated in a barren country about
four leagues distant from where he set out. When
Prince Ahmed came near these rocks, he perceived
an arrow, which he picked up, and was much astonished
to find that it was his.</p>

<p>19. "Certainly," said he to himself, "neither I nor
any man living could shoot an arrow so far!" and
finding it laid flat, not sticking into the ground, he
judged that it had rebounded against the rock.</p>

<p>20. As these rocks were full of caves, the prince
entered one, and, looking about, saw an iron door
which seemed to have no lock. Thrusting against
it, it opened, and revealed an easy descent, down
which he walked. At first he thought he was going
into a dark, gloomy place, but presently light succeeded;
and, entering into a large, open place, he perceived
a magnificent palace about fifty or sixty paces
distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>21. At the same time a lady of majestic port and
air advanced as far as the porch, attended by a large
troop of finely dressed and beautiful ladies.</p>

<p>The lady addressed him and said: "Come nearer,
Prince Ahmed; you are welcome."</p>

<p>22. It was no small surprise to the prince to hear
himself named in a place of which he had never
heard, though it was so near his father's capital; and
he could not understand how he should be known
to a lady who was a stranger to him.</p>

<p>23. He returned the lady's compliment by throwing
himself at her feet, saying: "Madam, I return
you a thousand thanks for your welcome. But may
I dare ask how you know me? And how you, who
live so near me, should be so great a stranger to me?"</p>

<p>"Prince," said the lady, "let us go into the hall;
there I will gratify your request."</p>

<p>24. The lady led Prince Ahmed into the hall, and,
when they were seated on a sofa, she said: "You are
surprised, you say, that I should know you and not
be known to you; but you will be no longer surprised
when I inform you who I am. I am the daughter
of one of the most powerful genies, and my name is
Peribanou. I was present when you drew your
arrow, and it was I who made it strike against the
rocks near which you found it. It lies in your
power to make use of the favorable opportunity
which presents itself to make you happy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>25. As the fairy Peribanou looked tenderly upon
Prince Ahmed, with a modest blush on her cheeks,
it was no hard matter for the prince to understand
what happiness she meant. He considered that the
Princess Nouronnihar could never be his, and that
the fairy Peribanou excelled her infinitely in beauty,
agreeableness, wit, and, as much as he could conjecture
by the magnificence of the palace, in immense riches.</p>

<p>26. He blessed the moment that he thought of
seeking after his arrow a second time, and replied:
"Madam, should I all my life have the happiness of
being your slave, I should think myself the most
fortunate of men. Don't refuse to admit into your
court a prince who is entirely devoted to you."</p>

<p>27. "Prince," answered the fairy, "will you not
pledge your faith to me, as I give mine to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam," replied the prince, in great joy;
"I give you my heart without the least reserve."</p>

<p>"Then," answered the fairy, "you are my husband
and I am your wife. Come, now, and I will
show you my palace."</p>

<p>28. The fairy Peribanou then carried him through
all the apartments, where he saw diamonds, rubies,
emeralds, and all sorts of fine jewels. The prince
owned that he could not have imagined that there
was in the world anything that could equal it.</p>

<p>The wedding feast was held the next day; or,
rather, the days following were a continual feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>29. At the end of six months Prince Ahmed, who
always loved and honored his father, the sultan,
longed to know how he was. He told the fairy of
this desire, and asked if it were her pleasure that he
should go to see his father.</p>

<p>30. "Prince," said she, "go when you please. But
first let me give you some advice: I think it will be
best for you not to tell the sultan, your father,
about me nor about our marriage. Beg him to be
satisfied in knowing that you are happy, and inform
him that the only end of your visit is to let him
know that you are well and happy."</p>

<p>31. She appointed twenty gentlemen, well
mounted and equipped, to attend him. When
all was ready, Prince Ahmed took his leave of the
fairy, embraced her, and renewed his promise to
return soon.</p>

<p>32. As it was not a great way to his father's
capital, Prince Ahmed soon arrived there. The
people, glad to see him again, received him with
shouts of joy.</p>

<p>The prince told the story of his adventures, but
without speaking of the fairy, and ended: "The
only favor I ask of your majesty is to give me leave
to come often and pay you my respects."</p>

<p>33. "Son," answered the sultan, "I cannot refuse
your request; but I should much rather you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
resolve to stay with me. At least tell me where
I may send to you if you should fail to come, or
if I should think your presence necessary."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied Prince Ahmed, "what your majesty
asks of me is part of a mystery. I beg of you to
give me leave to remain silent on this subject."</p>

<p>34. The sultan pressed Prince Ahmed no more,
but said to him: "Son, I penetrate no farther into
your secrets, but can tell you that whenever you
come you will always be welcome."</p>

<p>Prince Ahmed stayed but three days at his
father's court, and on the fourth day returned to
the fairy Peribanou, who did not expect him so
soon.</p>

<p>35. A month after Prince Ahmed's return from
paying a visit to his father, he went again, with the
same attendance as before, but much finer, and was
received by the sultan with the same joy and satisfaction.
For several months he continued his visits,
and each time with a richer and finer attendance
than before.</p>

<p>36. At last some viziers, the sultan's favorites,
who judged of Prince Ahmed's wealth and power
by his magnificent appearance, said that it was to
be feared Prince Ahmed might try to win the
people's favor and to dethrone his father.</p>

<p>The sultan was far from thinking that Prince
Ahmed could be capable of such a design, and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
"You are mistaken; my son loves me, and I am
certain of his tenderness and fidelity."</p>

<p>37. But the favorites went on abusing Prince
Ahmed, till the sultan said: "I cannot believe my
son Ahmed is so wicked as you would persuade me
he is; however, I am obliged to you for your good
advice."</p>

<p>38. The talk of his favorites had so alarmed the
sultan that he resolved to have Prince Ahmed
watched, unknown to his grand vizier. So he sent
for a female magician and said: "Go immediately
and follow my son; watch him so as to find out
where he retires, and bring me word."</p>

<p>39. The magician left the sultan, and, knowing
the place where Prince Ahmed found his arrow,
went immediately thither and hid herself near the
rocks so that nobody could see her.</p>

<p>The next morning Prince Ahmed set out by daybreak,
according to his custom. The magician,
seeing him coming, followed him with her eyes till
suddenly she lost sight of him and his attendants.</p>

<p>40. As the rocks were very steep and craggy, the
magician judged that the prince had gone either
into some cave or into an abode of genies or fairies.
Thereupon she came out of the place where she was
hid and looked carefully about on all sides, but
could perceive no opening. The iron gate which
Prince Ahmed had discovered was to be seen and
opened only by those whom the fairy Peribanou
favored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/illus137.jpg" width="375" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Prince Ahmed went out with his attendants.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a><br /><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>41. As Prince Ahmed never failed to visit the
sultan's court once a month, the magician, about the
time of his next visit, went to the foot of the rock
where she had lost sight of the prince and his attendants,
and waited there.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>42. The next morning Prince Ahmed went out, as
usual, at the iron gate, with his attendants, and
passed by the magician, whom he did not know to
be such. Seeing her lying with her head against the
rock and complaining as if she were in great pain,
he pitied her, and his attendants carried her back
through the iron gate into the court of the fairy's
palace.</p>

<p>43. The fairy Peribanou came at once to see why
the prince had returned so soon. Not giving her
time to ask him the reason, the prince said:
"Princess, I desire you to care for this poor
woman."</p>

<p>44. The fairy Peribanou ordered two of her attendants
to carry the woman into the palace.</p>

<p>While they obeyed the fairy's commands, she
went to Prince Ahmed and whispered: "Prince,
this woman is not so sick as she pretends to be;
and I am very much mistaken if she is not an im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>postor,
who will be the cause of great trouble to
you. But be persuaded that I will deliver you out
of all the snares that may be laid for you. Go and
pursue your journey."</p>

<p>45. These words of the fairy's did not in the least
frighten Prince Ahmed. "My princess," said he,
"as I do not remember ever to have done or intended
anybody an injury, I cannot believe anybody
can have a thought of doing me one; but, if
any one has, I shall not for that reason forbear
doing good whenever I have an opportunity."
Then he went on to his father's palace.</p>

<p>46. In the meantime the two women carried the
magician into a very fine apartment, richly furnished.
They made a bed for her, the sheets of
which were of the finest linen, and the coverlet
cloth-of-gold.</p>

<p>47. When they had put her into bed&mdash;for she
pretended that her fever was so violent that she
could not help herself in the least&mdash;one of the
women went out and brought a dish full of a certain
liquor, which she presented to the magician.</p>

<p>"Drink this liquor," said she; "it is the water of
the Fountain of Lions, and a sovereign cure for all
fevers. You will feel the effect of it in less than
an hour's time."</p>

<p>48. The two women came in an hour later and
found the magician up and dressed. "O admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
medicine!" she said. "It has cured me even
sooner than you told me it would, and I shall be
able to continue my journey."</p>

<p>According to the fairy's orders, the two women
then conducted the magician through several
magnificent apartments into a large hall most
richly furnished.</p>

<p>49. Peribanou sat in this hall on a throne of gold
enriched with diamonds, rubies, and pearls of an
extraordinary size, and attended on each hand by a
great number of beautiful fairies, all richly clothed.</p>

<p>50. At the sight of so much splendor, the magician
was so amazed that she could not speak.</p>

<p>However, Peribanou said to her: "Good woman,
I am glad to see that you are able to pursue your
journey. I will not detain you."</p>

<p>51. The magician went back and related to the
sultan all that had happened, and how Prince Ahmed
since his marriage with the fairy was richer than
all the kings in the world, and how there was danger
that he would come and take the throne from his
father.</p>

<p>52. Now the favorites advised that the prince
should be killed, but the magician advised differently:
"Make him give you all kinds of wonderful
things, by the fairy's help, till she tires of him and
sends him away. As, for example, might you not
ask him to procure a tent which can be carried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
a man's hand, and which will be so large as to
shelter your whole army against bad weather?"</p>

<p>53. When the magician had finished her speech,
the sultan asked his favorites if they had anything
better to propose; and finding them all silent, he
determined to follow the magician's advice.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>54. Next day the sultan did as the magician had
advised him, and asked for the great tent.</p>

<p>Prince Ahmed replied: "Though it is with the
greatest reluctance, I will not fail to ask of my wife
the favor your majesty desires, but I will not promise
you to obtain it; and, if I should not have the honor
to come again to pay you my respects, that will be
the sign that I have not had success. But, beforehand,
I desire you to forgive me and to consider that
you yourself have reduced me to this extremity."</p>

<p>55. "Son," replied the sultan of the Indies, "I
should be very sorry if what I ask of you should deprive
me of the pleasure of seeing you again. Your
wife would show that her love for you was very
slight if she, with the power of a fairy, should refuse
so small a request as this."</p>

<p>The prince went back, and was very sad for fear
of offending the fairy. She kept pressing him to
tell her what was the matter.</p>

<p>56. At last he said: "Madam, you may have ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>served
that hitherto I have been content with your
love and have never asked you any other favor.
Consider, then, I conjure you, that it is not I, but
the sultan, my father, who begs of you a tent
which is large enough to shelter him, his court,
and his army from the violence of the weather,
and which a man may carry in his hand. But
remember it is the sultan, my father, who asks
this favor."</p>

<p>57. "Prince," replied the fairy, smiling, "I am
sorry that so small a matter should disturb you."</p>

<p>Then the fairy sent for her treasurer, to whom
she said: "Nourgihan, bring me the largest tent in
my treasury."</p>

<p>58. Nourgihan returned presently with the tent&mdash;which
she could not only hold in her hand, but in
the palm of her hand when she shut her fingers&mdash;and
presented it to her mistress, who gave it to Prince
Ahmed.</p>

<p>59. When Prince Ahmed saw the tent which the
fairy called the largest in her treasury, he thought
that she jested with him. Peribanou, perceiving
this, said: "Nourgihan, go and set the tent up so
that the prince may judge whether it be large enough
for the sultan, his father."</p>

<p>60. The treasurer immediately carried it a great
way off; and when she had set it up, one end reached
to the palace, and the prince found it large enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
to shelter two greater armies than that of the
sultan.</p>

<p>He said to Peribanou: "I ask my princess a
thousand pardons for my incredulity. After what
I have seen, I believe there is nothing impossible to
you."</p>

<p>61. The treasurer took down the tent and brought
it to the prince, who took it, and the next day
mounted his horse and went with his attendants to
his father's court.</p>

<p>The sultan, who was persuaded that there could
not be such a tent as he had asked for, was greatly
surprised when he saw it.</p>

<p>62. But he was not yet satisfied, and he requested
his son to bring him some water from the Fountain
of Lions, which was a sovereign remedy for all sorts
of fevers. By the aid of the fairy Peribanou, Prince
Ahmed found this fountain, passed safely through
all the perils of the way, and returned to the sultan
with the water he had required.</p>

<p>63. The sultan showed outwardly all the signs of
great joy, but secretly became more jealous, and by
the advice of the magician he said to Prince Ahmed:
"Son, I have one thing more to ask of you, after
which I shall expect nothing more from your obedience
nor from your interest with your wife. This
request is to bring me a man not above a foot and
a half high, whose beard is thirty feet long, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
carries upon his shoulders a bar of iron of five
hundredweight, which he uses as a quarterstaff."</p>

<p>64. Prince Ahmed, who did not believe that there
was such a man in the world as his father described,
would gladly have excused himself; but the sultan
persisted in his demand, and told him the fairy
could do more incredible things.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>65. The next day the prince returned to his dear
Peribanou, to whom he told his father's new demand,
which, he said, he looked upon to be a thing
more impossible than the other two. "For," added
he, "I cannot imagine there can be such a man in
the world. How can my father suppose that I
should be able to find a man so small and at the
same time so well armed? What arms can I make
use of to reduce him to my will?"</p>

<p>66. "Don't be frightened, prince," replied the
fairy; "you ran a risk in getting the water of the
Fountain of Lions for your father, but there is no
danger in finding this man, who is my brother
Schaibar. Far from being like me, he is of so violent
a nature that nothing can prevent his resenting
a slight offence; yet, on the other hand, he is so
good as to oblige any one in whatever is desired.
He is exactly as the sultan, your father, has
described him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus146.jpg" width="700" height="514" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>There arose a thick cloud of smoke.</p></div>
</div>

<p>67. "I'll send for him, and you shall judge of the
truth of what I tell you; but prepare yourself not
to be frightened at his extraordinary appearance."</p>

<p>"What! my queen," replied Prince Ahmed; "do
you say Schaibar is your brother? Let him be
never so ugly and deformed, I shall be so far from
being frightened at the sight of him that, as our
brother, I shall honor and love him."</p>

<p>68. The fairy ordered a gold chafing dish to be
set with a fire in it in the porch of her palace, and
taking a perfume, she threw it into the fire, out of
which there arose a thick cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>69. Some moments after, the fairy said to Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Ahmed: "See, here comes my brother." The prince
immediately perceived Schaibar coming gravely,
with his heavy bar on his shoulder; his long beard,
which he held up before him; and a pair of thick
moustachios, which he tucked behind his ears and
which almost covered his face. His eyes were very
small and deep-set in his head, and he wore a high
cap; besides all this, he was very much humpbacked.</p>

<p>70. Schaibar, as he came forward, looked at the
prince earnestly enough to chill the blood in his
veins, and asked Peribanou who he was. To which
she replied: "He is my husband, brother. His
name is Ahmed; he is the son of the sultan of the
Indies. The reason why I did not invite you to my
wedding was that I was unwilling to divert you
from an expedition in which you were engaged, and
from which I heard with pleasure that you returned
victorious, and so I took the liberty to call
for you."</p>

<p>71. At these words, Schaibar, looking on Prince
Ahmed favorably, said: "Is there anything, sister,
wherein I can serve him? That he is your husband
is enough to engage me to do for him whatever he
desires."</p>

<p>"The sultan, his father," replied Peribanou, "has
a curiosity to see you, and I desire that the prince
may be your guide to the sultan's court."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>72. Schaibar and Prince Ahmed set out for the
sultan's court. When they arrived at the gates of
the capital, the people no sooner saw Schaibar than
they ran and hid themselves; so that Schaibar and
Prince Ahmed, as they went along, found the
streets all deserted till they came to the palace.
There the porters, instead of keeping the gates, ran
away, too, so that the prince and Schaibar advanced
to the council hall, where the sultan was seated on
his throne, giving audience.</p>

<p>73. Schaibar went boldly up to the throne, without
waiting to be presented by Prince Ahmed, and
addressed the sultan in these words: "Thou hast
asked for me; see, here I am. What wouldst thou
have with me?"</p>

<p>74. The sultan, instead of answering him, clapped
his hands before his eyes to avoid the sight of so
terrible an object; at which rude reception Schaibar
was so much provoked, after he had taken the
trouble to come so far, that he instantly lifted up his
iron bar and killed the sultan before Prince
Ahmed could intercede.</p>

<p>75. All that the prince could do was to prevent
his killing the grand vizier by saying that this officer
had always given the sultan good advice.</p>

<p>After this Schaibar said: "This is not yet
enough; I will treat all the people in the same way
if they do not immediately acknowledge Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Ahmed, my brother-in-law, for their sultan and the
sultan of the Indies."</p>

<p>76. Then all that were there present made the air
echo again with the repeated shouts of "Long life
to Sultan Ahmed!" and immediately he was proclaimed
through the whole town. Schaibar had
him installed on the throne, and after he had
caused all to swear fidelity to Ahmed, he brought
Peribanou with all the pomp and grandeur imaginable,
and had her crowned sultaness of the Indies.</p>

<p>Make yourselves nests of pleasant thoughts!
None of us yet know, for none of us have been
taught in early youth, what fairy palaces we may
build of beautiful thoughts, proof against all adversity;
bright fancies, satisfied memories, noble
histories, faithful sayings, treasure-houses of precious
and restful thoughts, which care cannot disturb, nor
pain make gloomy, nor poverty take away from us;
houses built without hands, for our souls to live in.</p>

<h2>Sir Isaac Newton</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</span></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. On Christmas Day, in the year 1642, Isaac
Newton was born at the small village of Woolsthorpe,
in England. Little did his mother think,,
when she beheld her new-born babe, that he was to
explain many matters which had been a mystery
ever since the creation of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 424px;">
<img src="images/illus156.jpg" width="424" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Sir Isaac Newton</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Isaac's father being dead, Mrs. Newton was
married again to a clergyman and went to live at
North Witham. Her son was left to the care of
his good old grandmother, who was very kind to
him and sent him to school.</p>

<p>3. In his early years Isaac did not appear to be a
very bright scholar, but was chiefly remarkable for
his ingenuity. He had a set of little tools and saws
of various sizes, manufactured by himself. With
the aid of these Isaac made many curious articles,
at which he worked with so much skill that he
seemed to have been born with a saw or chisel in
hand.</p>

<p>4. The neighbors looked with admiration at the
things which Isaac manufactured. And his old
grandmother, I suppose, was never weary of talking
about him.</p>

<p>"He'll make a capital workman one of these
days," she would probably say. "No fear but
what Isaac will do well in the world and be a rich
man before he dies."</p>

<p>5. It is amusing to conjecture what were the expectations
of his grandmother and the neighbors
about Isaac's future life. Some of them, perhaps,
fancied that he would make beautiful furniture.
Others probably thought that little Isaac would be
an architect, and would build splendid houses, and
churches with the tallest steeples that had ever
been seen in England.</p>

<p>6. Some of his friends, no doubt, advised Isaac's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
grandmother to apprentice him to a clock-maker;
for, besides his mechanical skill, the boy seemed to
have a taste for mathematics, which would be very
useful to him in that profession.</p>

<p>7. And then, in due time, Isaac would set up for
himself, and would manufacture curious clocks like
those that contain sets of dancing figures which
come from the dial-plate when the hour is struck;
or like those where a ship sails across the face of
the clock and is seen tossing up and down on the
waves as often as the pendulum vibrates.</p>

<p>8. Indeed, there was some ground for supposing
that Isaac would devote himself to the manufacture
of clocks, since he had already made one of a kind
which nobody had ever heard of before. It was set
a-going, not by wheels and weights like other
clocks, but by the dropping of water.</p>

<p>9. This was an object of great wonderment to
all the people round about; and it must be confessed
that there are few boys, or men either, who
could contrive to tell what o'clock it is by means
of a bowl of water.</p>

<p>10. Besides the water clock, Isaac made a sundial.
Thus his grandmother was never at a loss to know
the hour; for the water clock would tell it in the
shade and the dial in the sunshine. The sundial is
said to be still at Woolsthorpe, on the corner of the
house where Isaac dwelt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>11. If so, it must have marked the passage of every
sunny hour that has passed since Isaac Newton was
a boy. It marked all the famous moments of his
life; it marked the hour of his death; and still the
sunshine creeps slowly over it, as regularly as when
Isaac first set it up.</p>

<p>12. Yet we must not say that the sundial has lasted
longer than its maker; for Isaac Newton will exist
long after the dial&mdash;yes, and long after the sun itself&mdash;shall
have crumbled to decay.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>13. Isaac possessed a wonderful power of gaining
knowledge by the simplest means. For instance,
what method do you suppose he took to find out
the strength of the wind? You will never guess
how the boy could compel that unseen, inconstant,
and ungovernable wonder, the wind, to tell him the
measure of its strength.</p>

<p>14. Yet nothing can be more simple. He jumped
against the wind; and by the length of his jump he
could calculate the force of a gentle breeze or a
tempest. Thus, even in his boyish sports he was
continually searching out the secrets of philosophy.</p>

<p>15. Not far from his grandmother's house there
was a windmill which worked on a new plan. Isaac
was in the habit of going thither frequently, and
would spend whole hours in examining its various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
parts. While the mill was at rest he pried into its
machinery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus160.jpg" width="600" height="526" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The windmill</p></div>
</div>

<p>16. When its broad sails were set in motion by
the wind, he watched the process by which the millstones
were made to turn and crush the grain that
was put into the hopper. After gaining a thorough
knowledge of its construction, he was observed to
be unusually busy with his tools.</p>

<p>17. It was not long before his grandmother and
all the neighborhood knew what Isaac had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
about. He had constructed a model of the windmill.
Though not so large, I suppose, as one of the
box traps which boys set to catch squirrels, yet
every part of the mill and its machinery was complete.</p>

<p>18. Its little sails were neatly made of linen, and
whirled round very swiftly when the mill was placed
in a draught of air. Even a puff of wind from
Isaac's mouth or from a pair of bellows was sufficient
to set the sails in motion. And, what was most
curious, if a handful of grains of wheat was put
into the little hopper, they would soon be converted
into snow-white flour.</p>

<p>19. Isaac's playmates were enchanted with his new
windmill. They thought that nothing so pretty
and so wonderful had ever been seen in the whole
world.</p>

<p>"But, Isaac," said one of them, "you have forgotten
one thing that belongs to a mill."</p>

<p>20. "What is that?" asked Isaac; for he supposed
that, from the roof of the mill to its foundation, he
had forgotten nothing.</p>

<p>"Why, where is the miller?" said his friend.</p>

<p>"That is true; I must look out for one," said
Isaac; and he set himself to consider how the deficiency
should be supplied.</p>

<p>21. He might easily have made a little figure like
a man; but then it would not have been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
move about and perform the duties of a miller. It
so happened, however, that a mouse had just been
caught in the trap; and, as no other miller
could be found, Mr. Mouse was appointed to that
important office.</p>

<p>22. The new miller made a very respectable appearance
in his dark gray coat. To be sure, he had
not a very good character for honesty, and was suspected
of sometimes stealing a portion of the grain
which was given him to grind. But perhaps some
two-legged millers are quite as dishonest as this
small quadruped.</p>

<p>23. As Isaac grew older, it was found that he had
far more important matters in his mind than the
manufacture of toys like the little windmill. All
day long, if left to himself, he was either absorbed
in thought or engaged in some book of mathematics
or natural philosophy.</p>

<p>24. At night, I think it probable, he looked up
with reverential curiosity to the stars and wondered
whether they were worlds like our own, and how
great was their distance from the earth, and what
was the power that kept them in their courses.
Perhaps, even so early in life, Isaac Newton felt
that he should be able some day to answer all
these questions.</p>

<p>25. When Isaac was fourteen years old, his
mother's second husband being now dead, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
wished her son to leave school and assist her in
managing the farm at Woolsthorpe. For a year or
two, therefore, he tried to turn his attention to
farming. But his mind was so bent on becoming a
scholar that his mother sent him back to school, and
afterwards to the University of Cambridge.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>26. I have now finished my anecdotes of Isaac
Newton's boyhood. My story would be far too
long were I to mention all the splendid discoveries
which he made after he came to be a man.</p>

<p>He was the first that found out the nature of
light; for, before his day, nobody could tell what
the sunshine was composed of.</p>

<p>27. You remember, I suppose, the story of an
apple's falling on his head and thus leading him to
discover the force of gravitation, which keeps the
heavenly bodies in their courses. When he had
once got hold of this idea, he never permitted his
mind to rest until he had searched out all the laws
by which the planets are guided through the sky.</p>

<p>28. This he did as thoroughly as if he had gone
up among the stars and tracked them in their
orbits. The boy had found out the mechanism of
a windmill; the man explained to his fellow men
the mechanism of the universe.</p>

<p>29. While making these researches he was accus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>tomed
to spend night after night in a lofty tower,
gazing at the heavenly bodies through a telescope.
His mind was lifted far above the things of this
world. He may be said, indeed, to have spent the
greater part of his life in worlds that lie thousands
and millions of miles away; for where the thoughts
and the heart are, there is our true life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus164.jpg" width="700" height="466" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>There stood little Diamond, the author of all the mischief.</p></div>
</div>

<p>30. Did you never hear the story of Newton and
his little dog, Diamond? One day, when he was
fifty years old, and had been hard at work more
than twenty years studying the theory of light, he
went out of his chamber, leaving his little dog
asleep before the fire.</p>

<p>31. On the table lay a heap of manuscript papers
containing all the discoveries which Newton had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
made during those twenty years. When his master
was gone, up rose little Diamond, jumped upon the
table, and overthrew the lighted candle. The papers
immediately caught fire.</p>

<p>32. Just as the destruction was completed, Newton
opened the chamber door and perceived that the
labors of twenty years were reduced to a heap of
ashes. There stood little Diamond, the author of
all the mischief. Almost any other man would
have sentenced the dog to immediate death. But
Newton patted him on the head, with his usual
kindness, although grief was at his heart.</p>

<p>33. "O Diamond, Diamond," exclaimed he, "thou
little knowest the mischief thou hast done!"</p>

<p>This incident affected his health and spirits for
some time afterwards; but, from his conduct
towards the little dog, you may judge what was
the sweetness of his temper.</p>

<p>34. Newton lived to be a very old man, and
acquired great fame. He was made a member of
Parliament and was knighted by the king. But he
cared little for earthly fame and honors, and felt no
pride in the vastness of his knowledge. All that
he had learned only made him feel how little he
knew in comparison to what remained to be known.</p>

<p>35. "I seem to myself like a child," he observed,
"playing on the sea-shore and picking up here and
there a curious shell or a pretty pebble, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
boundless ocean of truth lies undiscovered before
me."</p>

<p>36. At last, in 1727, when he was fourscore and
five years old, Sir Isaac Newton died&mdash;or, rather, he
ceased to live on earth. We may be permitted to
believe that he is still searching out the infinite wisdom
and goodness of the Creator as earnestly, and
with even more success, than while his spirit animated
a mortal body.</p>

<p>He has left a fame behind him which will be as
lasting as if his name were written in letters of light
formed by the stars upon the midnight sky.</p>

<h2>Tom Goes down to the Sea</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Charles Kingsley</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Charles Kingsley (1819-1875): An English clergyman,
who was the author of several popular novels. He wrote
two books for children which have become child classics&mdash;"The
Heroes," a collection of Greek fairy tales, and "The
Water-Babies."</p>

<p>This selection is from "The Water-Babies," which is a
story about the strange and beautiful changes which go on in
the water. Tom was a little chimney sweep whom the fairies
changed into a water-baby. He had been a poor, neglected
little boy, who was mischievous and unkind because he knew
no better. At first he was a mischievous, unkind water-baby,
and the water-creatures found no pleasure in playing with
him, so that for a while he was very lonely. But, as he
learned to be more kind and loving, he won friends. Here
is the story of his journey in search of other water-babies,
whom at last he found in the great sea.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. And then, on the evening of a very hot day,
Tom, the water-baby, saw a sight.</p>

<p>He had been very stupid all day, and so had the
trout, for they would not move an inch to take a
fly, though there were thousands on the water, but
lay dozing at the bottom, under the shade of the
stones; and Tom lay dozing, too, and was glad to
cuddle their smooth, cool sides, for the water was
quite warm and unpleasant.</p>

<p>2. But toward evening it grew suddenly dark, and
Tom looked up and saw a blanket of black clouds
lying right across the valley above his head, resting
on the crags right and left. He felt not quite
frightened, but very still, for everything was still.
There was not a whisper of wind nor a chirp of a
bird to be heard; and next a few great drops of rain
fell plop into the water, and one hit Tom on the
nose and made him pop his head down quickly
enough.</p>

<p>3. And then the thunder roared, and the lightning
flashed, and leaped across Vendale and back
again, from cloud to cloud and cliff to cliff, till the
very rocks in the stream seemed to shake; and Tom
looked up at it through the water and thought it the
finest thing he ever saw in his life.</p>

<p>4. But out of the water he dared not put his head;
for the rain came down by bucketfuls, and the hail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
hammered like shot on the stream and churned it
into foam; and soon the stream rose, and rushed
down, higher and higher, and fouler and fouler, full
of beetles and sticks and straws and worms and
this, that, and the other.</p>

<p>Tom could hardly stand against the stream,
and hid behind a rock. But the trout did not;
for out they rushed from among the stones, and began
gobbling the beetles and leeches in the most
greedy and quarrelsome way.</p>

<p>6. And now, by the flashes of lightning, Tom saw
a new sight&mdash;all the bottom of the stream alive
with great eels, turning and twisting along, all
down stream and away. They had been hiding for
weeks past in the cracks of the rocks and in burrows
in the mud, and Tom had hardly ever seen
them, except now and then at night; but now they
were all out, and went hurrying past him so fiercely
and wildly that he was quite frightened.</p>

<p>7. And, as they hurried past, he could hear them
say to each other: "We must run, we must run.
What a jolly thunder storm! Down to the sea,
down to the sea!"</p>

<p>And then the otter came by with all her brood,
saying: "Come along, children; we will breakfast
on salmon to-morrow. Down to the sea, down to
the sea!"</p>

<p>8. "Down to the sea?" said Tom. "Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
is going to the sea, and I will go, too. Good-bye,
trout." But the trout were so busy gobbling worms
that they never turned to answer him; so that Tom
was spared the pain of bidding them farewell.</p>

<p>9. And now, down the rushing stream, guided by
the bright flashes of the storm; past tall birch-fringed
rocks, which shone out one moment as clear
as day, and the next were dark as night; past dark
hovers under swirling banks; on through narrow
strids and roaring cataracts, where Tom was deafened
and blinded for a moment by the rushing
waters; along deep reaches, where the white water
lilies tossed and flapped beneath the wind and
hail; past sleeping villages; under dark bridge
arches, and away and away to the sea.</p>

<p>10. And Tom could not stop and did not care to
stop; he would see the great world below, and the
salmon, and the breakers, and the wide, wide sea.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>11. And when the day came, Tom found himself
out in the salmon river. And after a while he came
to a place where the river spread out into broad,
still, shallow reaches so wide that little Tom, as he
put his head out of the water, could hardly see
across.</p>

<p>12. And there he stopped. He got a little
frightened. "This must be the sea," he thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
"What a wide place it is! If I go on into it, I
shall surely lose my way or some strange thing will
bite me. I will stop here and look out for the otter
or the eels, or some one to tell me where I shall
go."</p>

<p>13. So he went back a little way and crept into a
crack of the rock, just where the river opened out
into the wide shallows, and watched for some one to
tell him his way; but the otter and the eels were
gone on miles and miles down the stream.</p>

<p>14. There he waited, and slept, too, for he was
quite tired with his night's journey; and when he
woke, the stream was clearing to a beautiful amber
hue, though it was still very high.</p>

<p>15. Tom went on down, and, as he went, all the
vale looked sad. The red and yellow leaves
showered down into the river; the flies and beetles
were all dead and gone; the chill autumn fog lay
low upon the hills, and sometimes spread itself so
thickly on the river that he could not see his
way.</p>

<p>16. But he felt his way instead, following the
flow of the stream day after day, past great bridges,
past boats and barges, past the great town with its
wharves and mills and tall smoking chimneys, and
ships which rode at anchor in the stream; and now
and then he ran against their hawsers and wondered
what they were, and peeped out and saw the
sailors lounging on board, and ducked under
again, for he was terribly afraid of being caught by
man and turned into a chimney sweep once more.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>17. Poor little fellow! It was a dreary journey
for him; and more than once he longed to be back
in Vendale, playing with the trout in the bright
summer sun. But it could not be. What has been
once can never come over again. And people can
be little babies, even water-babies, only once in their
lives.</p>

<p>18. Besides, people who make up their minds to
go and see the world, as Tom did, must needs find
it a weary journey. Lucky for them if they do
not lose heart and stop half way, instead of going
on bravely to the end, as Tom did.</p>

<p>19. But Tom was always a brave, determined
little English bulldog, who never knew when he
was beaten; and on and on he held, till he saw a
long way off the red buoy through the fog. And
then he found, to his surprise, the stream turned
round and running up inland.</p>

<p>20. It was the tide, of course; but Tom knew
nothing of the tide. He only knew that in a
minute more the water, which had been fresh,
turned salt all around him. And then there came
a change over him. He felt strong and light and
fresh, and gave, he did not know why, three skips
out of the water, a yard high, and head over heels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
just as the salmon do when they first touch the
noble, rich salt water, which, as some wise men tell
us, is the mother of all living things.</p>

<p>21. He did not care now for the tide being against
him. The red buoy was in sight, dancing in the
open sea; and to the buoy he would go, and to it
he went. He passed great shoals of bass and mullet,
leaping and rushing in after the shrimps, but
he never heeded them nor they him; and once he
passed a great, black, shining seal who was coming
in after the mullet.</p>

<p>22. The seal put his head and shoulders out of
water and stared at him. And Tom, instead of
being frightened, said: "How d'ye do, sir? What
a beautiful place the sea is!"</p>

<p>23. And the old seal, instead of trying to bite
him, looked at him with his soft, sleepy, winking
eyes and said: "Good tide to you, my little man;
are you looking for your brothers and sisters? I
passed them all at play outside."</p>

<p>24. "Oh, then," said Tom, "I shall have playfellows
at last!" And he swam on to the buoy and
got upon it&mdash;for he was quite out of breath&mdash;and
sat there and looked round for water-babies; but
there were none to be seen.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>25. The sea breeze came in freshly with the tide
and blew the fog away, and the little waves danced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
for joy around the buoy, and the old buoy danced
with them. The shadows of the clouds ran races
over the bright, blue bay, and yet never caught
each other up; and the breakers plunged merrily
upon the wide white sands and jumped up over
the rocks to see what the green fields inside were
like, and tumbled down and broke themselves all
to pieces and never minded it a bit, but mended
themselves and jumped up again.</p>

<p>26. And the terns hovered over Tom like huge,
white dragon-flies with black heads; and the gulls
laughed like girls at play; and the sea-pies, with
their red bills and legs, flew to and fro from shore
to shore and whistled sweet and wild. And Tom
looked and looked and listened; and he would
have been very happy if he could only have seen
the water-babies.</p>

<p>27. Then, when the tide turned, he left the buoy
and swam round and round in search of them; but
in vain. Sometimes he thought he heard them
laughing; but it was only the laughter of the ripples.
And sometimes he thought he saw them at
the bottom; but it was only white and pink shells.</p>

<p>28. And once he was sure he had found one, for
he saw two bright eyes peeping out of the sand.
So he dived down and began scraping the sand
away, and cried: "Don't hide; I do want some one
to play with so much!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>And out jumped a great turbot, with his ugly
eyes and mouth all awry, and flopped away along
the bottom, knocking poor Tom over. And he sat
down at the bottom of the sea and cried salt tears
from sheer disappointment.</p>

<p>29. To have come all this way and faced so many
dangers, and yet to find no water-babies! How
hard! Well, it did seem hard; but people, even
little babies, cannot have all they want without
waiting for it, and working for it, too, my little
man, as you will find out some day.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>30. And Tom sat upon the buoy long days, long
weeks, looking out to the sea and wondering when
the water-babies would come back; and yet they
never came.</p>

<p>31. Then he began to ask all the strange things
which came in and out of the sea if they had seen
any; and some said "Yes," and some said nothing
at all. He asked the bass and the pollock; but they
were so greedy after the shrimps that they did not
care to answer him a word.</p>

<p>32. Then there came in a whole fleet of purple sea
snails, floating along, each on a sponge full of foam,
and Tom said: "Where do you come from, you
pretty creatures? and have you seen the water-babies?"</p>

<p>33. And the sea snails answered: "Whence we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
come, we know not; and whither we are going, who
can tell? We float out our life in the mid-ocean,
with the warm sunshine above our heads and the
warm Gulf Stream below; and that is enough for us.
Yes, perhaps we have seen the water-babies. We
have seen many strange things as we sailed along."</p>

<p>And they floated away, the happy, stupid things,
and all went ashore upon the sands.</p>

<p>34. Then there came in a great, lazy sunfish,
as big as a fat pig cut in half; and he seemed to
have been cut in half, too, and squeezed in a clothes-press
till he was flat; but to all his big body and
big fins he had only a little rabbit's mouth, no bigger
than Tom's; and when Tom questioned him he
answered him in a little, squeaky, feeble voice:</p>

<p>35. "I'm sure I don't know; I've lost my way. I
meant to go to the Chesapeake, and I'm afraid I've
got wrong somehow. Dear me! it was all by following
that pleasant warm water. I'm sure I've
lost my way."</p>

<p>And when Tom asked him again, he could only
answer: "I've lost my way. Don't talk to me; I
want to think."</p>

<p>36. Then there came up a shoal of porpoises, rolling
as they went&mdash;papas and mammas and little
children&mdash;and all quite smooth and shiny, because
the fairies French polish them every morning; and
they sighed so softly as they came by that Tom took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
courage to speak to them; but all they answered
was, "Hush, hush, hush!" for that was all they had
learned to say.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus180.jpg" width="700" height="502" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Tom and the lobster</p></div>
</div>

<p>37. And then Tom left the buoy and used to go
along the sands and round the rocks, and come out
in the night and cry and call for the water-babies;
but he never heard a voice call in return. And at
last, with his fretting and crying, he grew lean
and thin.</p>

<p>38. But one day among the rocks he found a
playfellow. It was not a water-baby, alas! but it
was a lobster; and a very distinguished lobster he
was, for he had live barnacles on his claws, which
is a great mark of distinction in lobsterdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>39. Tom had never seen a lobster before, and he
was mightily taken with this one, for he thought
him the most curious, odd, ridiculous creature he
had ever seen; and there he was not far wrong,
for all the ingenious men and all the scientific men
and all the fanciful men in the world could never
invent, if all their wits were boiled into one, anything
so curious and so ridiculous as a lobster.</p>

<p>40. He had one claw knobbed and the other
jagged; and Tom delighted in watching him hold
on to the seaweed with his knobbed claw while he
cut up salads with his jagged one, and then put
them into his mouth after smelling at them like a
monkey.</p>

<p>41. Tom asked him about water-babies. Yes,
he said, he had seen them often. But he did not
think much of them. They were meddlesome little
creatures that went about helping fish and shells
which got into scrapes. Well, for his part, he
would be ashamed to be helped by little, soft creatures
that had not even a shell on their backs. He
had lived quite long enough in the world to take
care of himself.</p>

<p>42. He was a conceited fellow, the old lobster, and
not very civil to Tom. But he was so funny and
Tom so lonely that he could not quarrel with him;
and they used to sit in holes in the rocks and chat
for hours.</p>

<h2>The Spartan Three Hundred</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. About five hundred years before the birth of
Christ, almost all the nations of Asia were under
the rule of Xerxes, the king of Persia, whom the
Greeks called the Great King. Xerxes had conquered
tribe after tribe and nation after nation,
until the greater part of the known world acknowledged
his rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But the little free states along the eastern
Mediterranean still remained unconquered, and
against these states of Greece Xerxes was leading
all the power of his mighty empire.</p>

<p>Ten years before, at the battle of Marathon, a
small Greek army had defeated the Persian hosts,
and Xerxes was resolved to avenge this humiliation.</p>

<p>3. At the battle of which I am going to tell you,
the overwhelming numbers of the Persians did indeed
win the victory, but the honor and glory of
the day rest with the little band of Greek heroes
who fought to the death for the freedom of their
country.</p>

<p>4. The Persian army in advancing on Greece were
obliged to march through a narrow pass, with the
sea on one side and a steep precipice on the other.
This pass was called Thermopyl&aelig;, and it was here
that the Greeks resolved to make a stand. They
did not know till they had marched to Thermopyl&aelig;
that behind the pass there was a mountain path by
which soldiers might climb round and over the
mountain and fall upon their rear.</p>

<p>5. The Greek army encamped in the pass, between
the narrow, northern gateway by which the enemy
must enter, and a gateway to the south. They were
protected in front by an old wall which they repaired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus188.jpg" width="650" height="416" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>This man rode up close to the Greek camp.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>6. The Greek general was Leonidas, a Spartan
king. He had with him three hundred Spartans
and a few thousand soldiers from other cities of
Greece. The Persians outnumbered them a hundred
to one. This small force was only the advance
guard of the Greek army. But Leonidas thought
that with it he could at least hold the pass till his
countrymen could join him.</p>

<p>7. When Xerxes came near Thermopyl&aelig;, he sent
a horseman forward to spy out the position of the
Greeks who dared oppose him. This man rode up
close to the Greek camp and saw the Spartans
amusing themselves, running and wrestling, and
combing out their long hair.</p>

<p>8. They took no notice of him, and he rode back
to tell the king how few they were and how unconcerned.
Xerxes sent for a Greek who was in his
camp and asked what these things meant.</p>

<p>9. The Greek replied: "O king, I have told you
before of these men, and you have laughed at me.
They have come to fight with you for this pass. It
is the Spartan custom to dress the hair with great
care before a battle. Be assured that if you conquer
the Spartans no other nation in the world will
dare stand against you, O king. For you are now
to engage with the noblest city and kingdom of all
among the Greeks, and the most valiant men."</p>

<p>10. Xerxes did not believe what the Greek said.
He waited four days to give the little band time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
retreat. Then, as it still held its ground, in a rage
he bade his warriors take the Greeks alive and
bring them into his presence. Accordingly, the
attack was made, but the Persians could not break
a way into the Spartan ranks. Fighting in the
narrow space at the mouth of the pass, they were
unable to avail themselves of their numbers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus190.jpg" width="650" height="490" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"They have come to fight with you for this pass."</p></div>
</div>

<p>11. In wave after wave all day long they dashed
themselves against the Greeks, and left their dead
lying at the mouth of the pass. Thereby it was
made clear to everyone, and not least to the great
king himself, that men were many, but heroes few.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>12. The next day the king ordered his own bodyguard,
called the Ten Thousand Immortals, to attack
the holders of the pass. The Immortals were
the picked soldiers of the whole army, but they
fared no better than the others. Three times the
king sprang from his throne in dismay as he saw
his soldiers driven back with great loss. And on
the third day the Persians fought with no better
success.</p>

<p>13. While the king was in doubt what to do, a
treacherous Greek came and told him about the path
over the mountains. Xerxes at once sent soldiers
along that path to attack the Greeks from the rear.</p>

<p>14. When the guards who had been stationed on
the mountain brought news of the coming of the
Persians, the Greeks were not agreed as to what
they should do. Some wanted to retreat and abandon
a position which it was now impossible to hold.</p>

<p>15. Leonidas bade them depart; but for him and
his countrymen it was not honorable to turn their
backs on any foe. For the manner of the Spartans
was this: to die rather than yield. However sorely
beset or overwhelmed by numbers, they never left
the ground alive and unvictorious.</p>

<p>16. Leonidas had two kinsmen in the camp whom
he tried to save by giving them messages and letters
to Sparta. But one answered that he had come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
fight, not to carry letters; and the other said that
his deeds would tell all that Sparta wished to know.
Another Spartan, when told that the enemy's archers
were so numerous that their arrows darkened the
sun, replied: "So much the better; we
shall fight in the shade."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/illus192.jpg" width="298" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A Spartan soldier</p></div>
</div>

<p>17. Some of the Greeks retired, but
a few resolved to stay with the brave
Spartans. And now the Greeks under
Leonidas did not wait to be attacked
in front and rear, but marched out
into the wide part of the pass and assailed
the Persians. The Persian officers
drove their soldiers forward with
whips. The poor wretches were pierced
with the Greek spears, hurled into the
sea, or trampled under foot.</p>

<p>18. The Spartans, knowing that death awaited
them, were desperate, and displayed the utmost possible
valor. When their spears were broken, they
assailed the Persians with their swords. And when
the swords gave out, they fought with their daggers,
and even with their hands and teeth, till not one
living man remained among them.</p>

<h2>Charles Dickens</h2>


<p>1. Charles Dickens, one of the most popular of
English novelists, was born in 1812 at Portsmouth,
where his father was a government clerk. When
he was two years old, the family moved to London,
and thence to Chatham dockyard.</p>

<p>2. Charles Dickens's father was poor; but, fortunately
for the book-loving boy, among the few family
possessions was a small library of good books,
and he spent many hours poring over "The Vicar of
Wakefield," "Robinson Crusoe," and the essays in
"The Tatler," "The Spectator," and "The Idler."
He and a boy cousin amused themselves during
their holidays by getting up private theatricals, for
which Charles wrote a play, "The Sultan of India,"
which was greatly admired by his boy friends.</p>

<p>3. These were happy, care-free days, but they
soon came to an end. The family went back to
London. The father first lost his government position,
and then was sent to prison for debt, according
to the law at that time. The mother went to
live with the father in prison, and Charles had to
earn his living by pasting labels on blacking-pots.
His wages were only six shillings a week, and with
this sum he had to support himself. The home was
entirely broken up; even the precious books were
sold; and these were sad, lonely days for the ten-year-old
boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Things brightened a little when he took lodgings
near the prison, where he could see his father
and mother every day. As it was a family trait to
look upon the bright side of things, even the prison
life was not intolerable. By and by better days
came, and Charles had two years of school life.</p>

<p>5. Then he became office boy in a lawyer's office.
In his seventeenth year he became a reporter, having
learned shorthand in the reading-room of the
British Museum.</p>

<p>6. His career as a writer began a few years later,
when he sent some sketches of street life to a magazine.
These sketches were signed "Boz." They were
so good that a year later he was employed to write
similar articles for a newspaper, and they appeared
in book form under the title, "Sketches by Boz."</p>

<p>7. This led to an offer by a publishing firm for a
series of articles to appear with a set of comic drawings.
Dickens wrote for them in 1836 the famous
"Pickwick Papers." This consisted of sketches relating
the adventures of an imaginary club of Londoners
during their visits to the country. It made
Dickens famous at once. The next year he published
his first novel, "Oliver Twist." This struck a new
note in fiction, and gave pitch to the life work of
the author; for from this time he never wavered in
his purpose, which was the portrayal of the life of
the lower classes and the righting of social wrongs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>8. One of the most popular of Dickens's books
is "David Copperfield," which is supposed to contain
many reminiscences of the author's own early
days. In this book occur some of the most famous
of Dickens's characters.</p>

<p>9. Among his other works Dickens produced a
series of tales called "The Christmas Stories." The
first of these, "A Christmas Carol," appeared in 1843,
and for a number of years he published a story of
this kind every year. The most celebrated of these
stories are "A Christmas Carol," "The Cricket on
the Hearth," and "The Chimes." In these stories
Dickens did more than give to the world pleasant
and interesting tales of domestic life; he portrayed
the true spirit of Christmastide, with its lessons of
peace and good will.</p>

<p>10. Dickens also wrote "A Tale of Two Cities,"
"Nicholas Nickleby," and "A Child's History of
England," which is a great favorite with young
people. He died suddenly in 1870 and was buried
in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>This selection is from "Bleak House," one of the
best of Dickens's novels.</p>

<h2>Little Charley</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Charles Dickens</span></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. We found the house to which we had been
directed by a friend of my guardian, and we went
up to the top room. I tapped at the door, and a
little shrill voice inside said: "We are locked in;
Mrs. Blinder's got the key."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 545px;">
<img src="images/illus198.jpg" width="545" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The boy walked up and down.</p></div>
</div>

<p>2. We had been prepared for this by Mrs. Blinder,
the shopkeeper below, who had given us the key
of the room.</p>

<p>3. I applied the key on
hearing this, and opened the
door. In a poor room, with
a sloping ceiling, and containing
very little furniture, was
a mite of a boy, some five or
six years old, nursing and
hushing a heavy child of
eighteen months. There was
no fire, though the weather
was cold; both children were
wrapped in some poor shawls
and tippets as a substitute. Their clothing was not
so warm, however, but that their noses looked red
and pinched and their small figures shrunken, as
the boy walked up and down, nursing and hushing
the child, with its head on his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>4. "Who has locked you up here alone?" we
naturally asked.</p>

<p>"Charley," said the boy, standing still to gaze at us.</p>

<p>"Is Charley your brother?"</p>

<p>"No. She's my sister Charlotte. Father called
her Charley."</p>

<p>5. "Where is Charley now?"</p>

<p>"Out a-washing," said the boy, beginning to walk
up and down again, and taking the baby's nankeen
bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to
gaze at us at the same time.</p>

<p>6. We were looking at one another and at these
two children, when there came into the room a very
little girl, childish in figure, but shrewd and older
looking in the face&mdash;pretty faced, too&mdash;wearing a
womanly sort of bonnet much too large for her and
drying her bare arms on a womanly sort of apron.
Her fingers were white and wrinkled with washing,
and the soapsuds were yet smoking which she wiped
off her arms. But for this she might have been a
child playing at washing and imitating a poor workingwoman
with a quick observation of the truth.</p>

<p>7. She had come running from some place in the
neighborhood, and had made all the haste she could.
Consequently, though she was very light, she was
out of breath and could not speak at first, as she
stood panting, and wiping her arms, and looking
quietly at us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>8. "Oh, here's Charley!" said the boy.</p>

<p>The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms
and cried out to be taken by Charley. The little
girl took it in a womanly sort of manner belonging
to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at
us over the burden that clung to her most affectionately.</p>

<p>9. "Is it possible," whispered my guardian, as we
put a chair for the little creature and got her to sit
down with her load&mdash;the boy keeping close to her,
holding to her apron&mdash;"that this child works for
the rest! Look at this! Look at this!"</p>

<p>10. It was a thing to look at. The three children
close together, and two of them relying solely
on the third, and the third so young and yet with an
air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the
childish figure.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>11. "Charley, Charley," said my guardian, "how
old are you?"</p>

<p>"Over thirteen, sir," replied the child.</p>

<p>12. "Oh, what a great age!" said my guardian.
"What a great age, Charley!"</p>

<p>I cannot describe the tenderness with which he
spoke to her, half playfully, yet all the more compassionately
and mournfully.</p>

<p>13. "And do you live alone here with these babies,
Charley?" said my guardian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">
<img src="images/illus201.jpg" width="380" height="550" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Little Charley came in.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a><br /><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," returned the child, looking up into his
face with perfect confidence, "since father died."</p>

<p>14. "And how do you live, Charley? O Charley,"
said my guardian, turning his face away for a moment,
"how do you live?"</p>

<p>"Since father died, sir, I've gone out to work.
I'm out washing to-day."</p>

<p>15. "God help you, Charley!" said my guardian.
"You're not tall enough to reach the tub."</p>

<p>"In pattens, I am, sir," she said quickly. "I've
got a high pair that belonged to mother."</p>

<p>"And when did mother die? Poor mother!"</p>

<p>16. "Mother died just after Emma was born," said
the child, glancing at the face upon her bosom.
"Then father said I was to be as good a mother to
her as I could. And so I tried. And so I worked
at home, and did cleaning and nursing and washing
for a long time before I began to go out. And that's
how I know how; don't you see, sir?"</p>

<p>17. "And do you often go out?"</p>

<p>"As often as I can," said Charley, opening her
eyes and smiling, "because of earning sixpences and
shillings."</p>

<p>18. "And do you always lock the babies up when
you go out?"</p>

<p>"To keep 'em safe, sir, don't you see?" said
Charley. "Mrs. Blinder comes up now and then,
and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes, and perhaps I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
can run in sometimes; and they can play, you know,
and Tom isn't afraid of being locked up. Are you,
Tom?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;o!" said Tom, stoutly.</p>

<p>19. "When it comes on dark, the lamps are lighted
down in the court, and they show up here quite
bright&mdash;almost quite bright. Don't they, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Charley," said Tom; "almost quite bright."</p>

<p>20. "Then, he's as good as gold," said the little
creature&mdash;oh! in such a motherly, womanly way.
"And when Emma's tired, he puts her to bed. And
when he's tired, he goes to bed himself. And when
I come home and light the candle and have a bit of
supper, he sits up again and has it with me. Don't
you, Tom?"</p>

<p>21. "Oh, yes, Charley," said Tom. "That I do!"
And either in this glimpse of the great pleasure of
his life, or in gratitude and love for Charley, who
was all in all to him, he laid his face among the
scanty folds of her frock and passed from laughing
into crying.</p>

<p>22. It was the first time since our entry that a tear
had been shed among these children. The little
orphan girl had spoken of their father and their
mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the
necessity of taking courage, and by her childish importance
in being able to work, and by her bustling,
busy way. But now, when Tom cried&mdash;although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
she sat quite tranquil, looking quietly at us, and did
not by any movement disturb a hair of the head of
either of her little charges&mdash;I saw two silent tears
fall down her face.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 510px;">
<img src="images/illus205.jpg" width="510" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>Mrs. Blinder</p></div>
</div>

<p>23. I stood at the window with Ada, pretending
to look at the housetops, and the blackened stack of
chimneys, and the poor plants, and
the birds, in little cages, belonging to
the neighbors, when I found that
Mrs. Blinder, from the shop below,
had come in&mdash;perhaps it had
taken her all this time to get upstairs&mdash;and
was talking to my
guardian.</p>

<p>"It's not much to forgive
'em the rent, sir," she said.
"Who could take it from
them!"</p>

<p>24. "Well, well!" said my
guardian to us two. "It is enough that the time
will come when this good woman will find that it
was much, and that forasmuch as she did it unto
the least of these&mdash;This child," he added, after a
few moments, "could she possibly continue this?"</p>

<p>25. "Really, sir, I think she might," said Mrs.
Blinder, getting her heavy breath by painful degrees.
"She's as handy as it's possible to be. Bless
you, sir, the way she tended the two children after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the mother died was the talk of the yard. And it
was a wonder to see her with him after he was ill,
it really was. 'Mrs. Blinder,' he said to me, the
very last he spoke&mdash;he was lying there&mdash;'Mrs.
Blinder, I saw an angel sitting in this room last
night along with my child, and I trust her to our
Father.'"</p>

<p>26. We kissed Charley, and took her down-stairs
with us, and stopped outside the house to see her
run away to her work. I don't know where she
was going, but we saw her run&mdash;such a little, little
creature, in her womanly bonnet and apron&mdash;through
a covered way at the bottom of the court,
and melt into the city's strife and sound like a dewdrop
in an ocean.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>27. One night, after I had gone to my room, I
heard a soft tap at my door. So I said, "Come in,"
and there came in a pretty little girl, neatly dressed
in mourning, who dropped a courtesy.</p>

<p>28. "If you please, miss," said the little girl, in a
soft voice, "I am Charley."</p>

<p>"Why, so you are!" said I, stooping down in
astonishment, and giving her a kiss. "How glad I
am to see you, Charley!"</p>

<p>29. "If you please, miss," pursued Charley, in the
same soft voice, "I'm your maid."</p>

<p>"Charley?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 560px;">
<img src="images/illus207.jpg" width="560" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"Don't cry, if you please, miss."</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you please, miss, I'm a present to you, with
Mr. Jarndyce's love."</p>

<p>30. I sat down with my hand on Charley's neck,
and looked at Charley.</p>

<p>"And oh, miss," says Charley, clapping her hands,
with the tears starting down her dimpled cheeks,
"Tom's at school, if you please; and little Emma,
she's with Mrs. Blinder, miss. And Tom, he would
have been at school; and Emma, she would have
been left with Mrs. Blinder; and I should have been
here, all a deal sooner, miss; only Mr. Jarndyce
thought that Tom and Emma and I had better get
a little used to parting first, we were so small. Don't
cry, if you please, miss."</p>

<p>31. "I can't help it, Charley."</p>

<p>"No, miss, I can't help it," says Charley. "And,
if you please, miss, Mr. Jarndyce's love, and he
thinks you'll like to teach me now and then. And,
if you please, Tom and Emma and I are to see each
other once a month. And I'm so happy and so
thankful, miss," cried Charley, with a heaving heart,
"and I'll try to be such a good maid!"</p>

<p>32. Charley dried her eyes, and entered on her
functions, going in her matronly little way about
and about the room, and folding up everything she
could lay her hands upon.</p>

<p>33. Presently, Charley came creeping back to my
side, and said: "Oh, don't cry, if you please, miss."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>And I said again: "I can't help it, Charley."</p>

<p>And Charley said again: "No, miss; I can't help
it." And so, after all, I did cry for joy, indeed, and
so did she.</p>

<h2>The Golden Fleece</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Nathaniel Hawthorne</span></p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. When Jason, the son of the dethroned king
of Iolchos, was a little boy, he was sent away from
his parents and placed under the queerest schoolmaster
that ever you heard of. This learned person
was one of the people or quadrupeds called
Centaurs. He lived in a cavern, and had the body
and legs of a white horse, with the head and shoulders
of a man. His name was Chiron; and, in spite
of his odd appearance, he was a very excellent
teacher.</p>

<p>2. The good Chiron taught his pupils how to play
upon the harp, and how to cure diseases, and how
to use the sword and shield, together with various
other branches of education in which the lads of
those days used to be instructed, instead of writing
and arithmetic.</p>

<p>3. So Jason dwelt in the cave, with his four-footed
Chiron, from the time that he was an infant
only a few months old until he had grown to the
full height of a man.</p>

<p>4. At length, being now a tall and athletic youth,
Jason resolved to seek his fortune in the world.
He had heard that he himself was a prince royal,
and that his father, King &AElig;son, had been deprived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of the kingdom of Iolchos by a certain Pelias, who
would also have killed Jason had he not been
hidden in the Centaur's cave. And being come to
the strength of a man, Jason determined to set all
this business to rights, and to punish the wicked
Pelias for wronging his dear father, and to cast him
down from the throne and seat himself there instead.</p>

<p>5. With this intention he took a spear in each
hand, and threw a leopard's skin over his shoulders
to keep off the rain, and set forth on his travels,
with his long, yellow ringlets waving in the wind.
The part of his dress on which he most prided himself
was a pair of sandals that had been his father's.
They were handsomely embroidered, and were tied
upon his feet with strings of gold.</p>

<p>6. I know not how far Jason had traveled when
he came to a turbulent river, which rushed right
across his pathway, with specks of white foam
among its black eddies, hurrying onward, and roaring
angrily as it went. He stepped boldly into the
raging and foamy current and began to stagger away
from the shore.</p>

<p>7. Jason's two spears, one in each hand, kept him
from stumbling and enabled him to feel his way
among the hidden rocks. When he was half way
across, his foot was caught in a crevice between two
rocks, and stuck there so fast that, in the effort to
get free, he lost one of his golden-stringed sandals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>8. After traveling a pretty long distance, he came
to a town situated at the foot of a mountain, and
not a great way from the shore of the sea. On the
outside of the town there was an immense crowd of
people. Jason inquired of one of the multitude why
so many persons were here assembled.</p>

<p>9. "This is the kingdom of Iolchos," answered
the man, "and we are the subjects of King Pelias.
Our monarch has summoned us together that we
may see him sacrifice a black bull to Neptune. Yonder
is the king, where you see the smoke going up
from the altar."</p>

<p>10. While the man spoke, he eyed Jason with
great curiosity, for his garb was quite unlike that
of the Iolchians, and it looked very odd to see a
youth with a leopard's skin over his shoulders and
each hand grasping a spear. Jason perceived, too,
that the man stared particularly at his feet, one of
which, you remember, was bare, while the other
was decorated with his father's golden-stringed
sandal.</p>

<p>11. "Look at him! only look at him!" said the
man to his next neighbor. "Do you see? He wears
but one sandal."</p>

<p>Upon this, first one person and then another began
to stare at Jason, and everybody seemed to be
greatly struck with something in his aspect; though
they turned their eyes much oftener towards his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
feet than to any other part of his figure. Besides,
he could hear them whispering to one another.</p>

<p>12. Poor Jason was greatly abashed, and made up
his mind that the people of Iolchos were exceedingly
ill bred to take such public notice of an accidental
deficiency in his dress. Meanwhile, whether
it was that they hustled him forward, or that Jason
of his own accord thrust a passage through the
crowd, it so happened that he soon found himself
close to the smoking altar where King Pelias was
sacrificing the black bull.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>13. The murmur and hum of the multitude, in
their surprise at the spectacle of Jason with his one
bare foot, grew so loud that it disturbed the ceremonies;
and the king, holding the great knife
with which he was just going to cut the bull's
throat, turned angrily about and fixed his eyes on
Jason.</p>

<p>"Ha!" muttered he, "here is the one-sandaled
fellow, sure enough. What can I do with him?"</p>

<p>14. And he clutched more closely the great knife
in his hand, as if he were half a mind to slay Jason
instead of the black bull. The people round about
caught up the king's words, indistinctly as they
were uttered; and first there was a murmur among
them, and then a loud shout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"The one-sandaled man has come! The prophecy
must be fulfilled!"</p>

<p>15. For you are to know that, many years before,
King Pelias had been told that a man with one
sandal should cast him down from his throne. On
this account he had given strict orders that nobody
should ever come into his presence unless both
sandals were securely tied upon his feet.</p>

<p>16. In the whole course of the king's reign, he
had never been thrown into such a fright as by the
spectacle of poor Jason's bare foot. But, as he was
naturally a bold and hard-hearted man, he soon took
courage and began to consider in what way he might
rid himself of this terrible one-sandaled stranger.</p>

<p>17. "My good young man," said King Pelias, taking
the softest tone imaginable in order to throw
Jason off his guard, "you are very welcome to my
kingdom. Judging by your dress, you must have
traveled a long distance; for it is not the fashion to
wear leopard skins in this part of the world. Pray,
what may I call your name? and where did you
receive your education?"</p>

<p>18. "My name is Jason," answered the young
stranger. "Ever since my infancy I have dwelt in
the cave of Chiron the Centaur. He was my instructor
and taught me music and horsemanship,
and how to cure wounds, and likewise how to inflict
wounds with my weapons."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/illus216.jpg" width="355" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>"My name is Jason."</p></div>
</div>

<p>19. "I have heard of Chiron the schoolmaster,"
replied King Pelias. "It gives me great delight to
see one of his scholars at my court. But, to test
how much you have profited
under so excellent a teacher, will
you allow me to ask you a
single question?"</p>

<p>"I do not pretend to be very
wise," said Jason. "But ask me
what you please, and I will
answer to the best of my ability."</p>

<p>20. Now King Pelias meant
cunningly to entrap the young
man and to make him say something
that should be the cause of
mischief and destruction to himself.
So, with an evil smile upon
his face, he spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"What would you do, brave
Jason," asked he, "if there were a man in the world by
whom, as you had reason to believe, you were doomed
to be ruined and slain&mdash;what would you do, I say,,
if that man stood before you and in your power?"</p>

<p>21. When Jason saw the malice and wickedness
which King Pelias could not prevent from gleaming
out of his eyes, he probably guessed that the king
had discovered what he came for, and that he intended
to turn his own words against himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>22. Still he scorned to tell a falsehood. Like an
upright and honorable prince, as he was, he determined
to speak out the real truth. Since the king
had chosen to ask him the question, and since Jason
had promised him an answer, there was no right
way save to tell him precisely what would be the
most prudent thing to do if he had his worst enemy
in his power.</p>

<p>23. Therefore, after a moment's consideration, he
spoke up with a firm and manly voice.</p>

<p>"I would send such a man," said he, "in quest of
the Golden Fleece."</p>

<p>24. This enterprise, you will understand, was of all
others the most difficult and dangerous in the world.
In the first place, it would be necessary to make a
long voyage through unknown seas. There was
hardly a hope or a possibility that any young man
who should undertake this voyage would either succeed
in obtaining the Golden Fleece or would survive
to return home and tell of the perils he had
run. The eyes of King Pelias sparkled with joy,
therefore, when he heard Jason's reply.</p>

<p>25. "Well said, wise man with the one sandal!"
cried he. "Go, then, and at the peril of your life
bring me back the Golden Fleece."</p>

<p>"I go," answered Jason. "If I fail, you need not
fear that I will ever come back to trouble you again.
But if I return to Iolchos with the prize, then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
King Pelias, you must hasten down from your
throne and give me your crown and scepter."</p>

<p>"That I will," said the king, with a sneer.
"Meantime, I will keep them very safely for you."</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>26. The first thing that Jason thought of doing
after he left the king's presence was to go to
Dodona and inquire of the Talking Oak what course
it was best to pursue. This wonderful tree stood in
the center of an ancient wood. Its stately trunk rose
up a hundred feet into the air and threw a broad
and dense shadow over more than an acre of ground.</p>

<p>27. Standing beneath it, Jason looked up among
the knotted branches and green leaves and into the
mysterious heart of the old tree, and spoke aloud,
as if he were addressing some person who was hidden
in the depths of the foliage.</p>

<p>"What shall I do," said he, "in order to win the
Golden Fleece?"</p>

<p>28. At first there was a deep silence, not only
within the shadow of the Talking Oak, but all
through the solitary wood. In a moment or two,
however, the leaves of the oak began to stir and
rustle as if a gentle breeze were wandering amongst
them, although the other trees of the wood were
perfectly still. The sound grew louder and became
like the roar of a high wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>29. By and by Jason imagined that he could distinguish
words, but very confusedly, because each
separate leaf of the tree seemed to be a tongue, and
the whole myriad of tongues were babbling at once.
But the noise waxed broader and deeper, until it
resembled a tornado sweeping through the oak and
making one great utterance out of the thousand and
thousand of little murmurs which each leafy tongue
had caused by its rustling. And now, though it
still had the tone of mighty wind roaring among the
branches, it was also like a deep bass voice speakings
as distinctly as a tree could be expected to speak,
the following words:</p>

<p>"Go to Argus the shipbuilder, and bid him
build a galley with fifty oars."</p>

<p>30. Then the voice melted again into the indistinct
murmur of the rustling leaves and died gradually
away.</p>

<p>On inquiry among the people of Iolchos, he found
that there was really a man in the city, by the name
of Argus, who was a very skillful builder of vessels.
At Jason's request, Argus readily consented to build
him a galley so big that it should require fifty
strong men to row it; although no vessel of such a
size and burden had heretofore been seen in the
world.</p>

<p>The new ship, which was called the Argo, was
soon made quite ready for sea. Jason visited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Talking Oak again, and, standing beside its huge,
rough trunk, inquired what he should do next.</p>

<p>31. This time there was no such quivering of the
leaves throughout the whole tree as there had been
before. But after a while Jason observed that the
foliage of a great branch which stretched above his
head had begun to rustle, as if the wind were stirring
that old bough, while all the other boughs of
the oak were at rest.</p>

<p>"Cut me off," said the branch, as soon as it
could speak distinctly; "cut me off, cut me off,
and carve me into a figure-head for your galley."</p>

<p>32. Accordingly, Jason took the branch at its
word, and lopped it off the tree. A carver in
the neighborhood engaged to make the figure-head.
When the work was finished, it turned out
to be the figure of a beautiful woman with a helmet
on her head, from beneath which the long ringlets
fell down upon her shoulders. On the left arm
was a shield, and the right arm was extended as if
pointing onward.</p>

<p>33. Jason was delighted with the oaken image,
and gave the carver no rest until it was completed
and set up where a figure-head has always stood
from that time to this, in the vessel's prow.</p>

<p>"And now," cried he, as he stood gazing at the
calm, majestic face of the statue, "I must go to the
Talking Oak and inquire what next to do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>34. "There is no need of that, Jason," said a
voice which, though it was far lower, reminded
him of the mighty tones of the great oak. "When
you desire good advice, you can seek it of me."</p>

<p>Jason had been looking straight into the face of
the image when these words were spoken. But he
could hardly believe either his ears or his eyes.
The truth was, however, that the oaken lips had
moved, and, to all appearance, the voice had proceeded
from the statue's mouth.</p>

<p>35. Recovering a little from his surprise, Jason
bethought himself that the image had been carved
out of the wood of the Talking Oak, and that,
therefore, it was really no great wonder, but, on the
contrary, the most natural thing in the world that
it should possess the faculty of speech.</p>

<p>36. "Tell me, wondrous image," exclaimed Jason&mdash;"since
you inherit the wisdom of the Speaking
Oak of Dodona, whose daughter you are&mdash;tell me
where shall I find fifty bold youths who will
take each of them an oar of my galley? They must
have sturdy arms to row, and brave hearts to
encounter perils, or we shall never win the Golden
Fleece."</p>

<p>"Go," replied the oaken image, "go, summon all
the heroes of Greece."</p>

<p>37. And, in fact, considering what a great deed
was to be done, could any advice be wiser than this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
which Jason received from the figure-head of his
vessel? He lost no time in sending messengers to all
the cities and making known to the whole people
of Greece that Prince Jason, the son of King &AElig;son,
was going in quest of the Fleece of Gold, and that
he desired the help of forty-nine of the bravest and
strongest young men alive to row his vessel and
share his dangers. And Jason himself would be
the fiftieth.</p>

<p>38. At this news the adventurous youths all over
the country began to bestir themselves. They came
thronging to Iolchos and clambered on board the
new galley. Shaking hands with Jason, they assured
him that they did not care a pin for their lives, but
would help row the vessel to the remotest edge of
the world, and as much farther as they might think
it best to go.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>39. If I were to tell you all the adventures of the
Argonauts, it would take me till nightfall, and perhaps
a great deal longer. There was no lack of
wonderful events, any one of which would make a
story by itself. After many adventures, they at last
reached Colchis.</p>

<p>40. When the king of the country, whose name
was &AElig;etes, heard of their arrival, he instantly summoned
Jason to court. The king was stern and cruel
looking; and, though he put on as polite and hos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>pitable
an expression as he could, Jason did not like
his face a whit better than that of the wicked King
Pelias, who dethroned his father.</p>

<p>41. "You are welcome, brave Jason," said King
&AElig;etes. "Pray, are you on a pleasure voyage?&mdash;or
do you meditate the discovery of unknown islands?&mdash;or
what other cause has procured me the happiness
of seeing you at my court?"</p>

<p>42. "Great sir," replied Jason, "I have come hither
with a purpose which I now beg your majesty's permission
to execute. King Pelias, who sits on my
father's throne (to which he has no more right than
to the one on which your excellent majesty is now
seated), has engaged to come down from it and to
give me his crown and scepter provided I bring him
the Golden Fleece. This, as your majesty is aware,
is now hanging on a tree here at Colchis, and I
humbly solicit your gracious leave to take it away."</p>

<p>43. In spite of himself, the king's face twisted itself
into an angry frown; for, above all things else
in the world, he prized the Golden Fleece, and was
even suspected of having done a very wicked act in
order to get it into his own possession. It put him
into the worst possible humor, therefore, to hear that
the gallant Prince Jason and forty-nine of the bravest
young warriors of Greece had come to Colchis with
the sole purpose of taking away his chief treasure.</p>

<p>44. "Do you know," asked King &AElig;etes, eying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Jason very sternly, "what are the conditions which
you must fulfill before getting possession of the
Golden Fleece?"</p>

<p>"I have heard," rejoined the youth, "that a dragon
lies beneath the tree on which the prize hangs, and
that whoever approaches him runs the risk of being
devoured at a mouthful."</p>

<p>45. "True," said the king, with a smile that did
not look particularly good-natured. "Very true,
young man; but there are other things as hard, or
perhaps a little harder, to be done before you can
even have the privilege of being devoured by the
dragon. For example, you must first tame my two
brazen-footed and brazen-lunged bulls which Vulcan,
the wonderful blacksmith, made for me.</p>

<p>46. "There is a furnace in each of their stomachs,
and they breathe such hot fire out of their mouths
and nostrils that nobody has hitherto gone nigh them
without being instantly burned to a small, black
cinder. What do you think of this, my brave Jason?"</p>

<p>"I must encounter the peril," answered Jason,
"since it stands in the way of my purpose."</p>

<p>47. "After taming the fiery bulls," continued
King &AElig;etes, who was determined to scare Jason if
possible, "you must yoke them to a plow, and must
plow the sacred earth in the Grove of Mars, and sow
some of the dragon's teeth from which Cadmus
raised a crop of armed men. You and your nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and forty Argonauts, my bold Jason, are hardly
strong enough to fight with such a host as will
spring up."</p>

<p>48. "My master, Chiron," replied Jason, "taught
me long ago the story of Cadmus. Perhaps I can
manage the quarrelsome sons of the dragon's teeth
as well as Cadmus did."</p>

<p>"I wish the dragon had him," muttered King
&AElig;etes to himself. "We'll see what my fire-breathing
bulls will do for him. Well, Prince Jason," he
continued aloud and as complaisantly as he could,
"make yourself comfortable for to-day, and to-morrow
morning, since you insist upon it, you shall
try your skill at the plow."</p>

<p>49. While the king talked with Jason a beautiful
young woman was standing behind the throne.
She fixed her eyes earnestly upon the youthful
stranger, and listened attentively to every word
that was spoken; and when Jason withdrew from
the king's presence, this young woman followed
him out of the room.</p>

<p>50. "I am the king's daughter," she said to him,
"and my name is Medea. I know a great deal of
which other young princesses are ignorant, and can
do many things which they would be afraid so
much as to dream of. If you will trust to me, I
can instruct you how to tame the fiery bulls, and
sow the dragon's teeth, and get the Golden Fleece."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>51. "Indeed, beautiful princess," answered Jason,
"if you will do me this service, I promise to be
grateful to you my whole life long. But how can
you help me to do the things of which you speak I
Are you an enchantress?"</p>

<p>52. "Yes, Prince Jason," answered Medea, with a
smile, "you have hit upon the truth. I am an
enchantress. Circe, my father's sister, taught me to
be one. It is well for you that I am favorably
inclined; for, otherwise, you would hardly escape
being snapped up by the dragon."</p>

<p>"I should not so much care for the dragon,"
replied Jason, "if I only knew how to manage the
brazen-footed and fiery-lunged bulls."</p>

<p>53. "If you are as brave as I think you, and as
you have need to be," said Medea, "your own bold
heart will teach you that there is but one way of
dealing with a mad bull. What it is I leave you
to find out in the moment of peril. As for the
fiery breath of these animals, I have a charmed
ointment here which will prevent you from being
burned up, and cure you if you chance to be a little
scorched."</p>

<p>54. So she put a golden box into his hand and
directed him how to apply the ointment which it
contained, and where to meet her at midnight.</p>

<p>"Only be brave," added she, "and before daybreak
the brazen bulls shall be tamed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>55. The young man assured her that his heart
would not fail him. He then rejoined his comrades,
and told them what had passed between the
princess and himself, and warned them to be in
readiness in case there might be need of their help.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>56. At the appointed hour he met the beautiful
Medea on the marble steps of the king's palace.
She gave him a basket in which were the dragon's
teeth, just as they had been pulled out of the monster's
jaws by Cadmus long ago. Medea then led
Jason down the palace steps, and through the silent
streets of the city, and into the royal pasture ground,
where the two brazen-footed bulls were kept. It
was a starry night, with a bright gleam along the
eastern edge of the sky, where the moon was soon
going to show herself.</p>

<p>57. At some distance before him he perceived four
streams of fiery vapor, regularly appearing and
again vanishing, after dimly lighting up the surrounding
obscurity. These, you will understand,
were caused by the breath of the brazen bulls, which
was quietly stealing out of their four nostrils as
they lay chewing their cuds.</p>

<p>58. At the first two or three steps which Jason
made, the four fiery streams appeared to gush out
somewhat more plentifully; for the two brazen bulls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
had heard his foot tramp and were lifting up their
hot noses to snuff the air. He went a little farther,
and by the way in which the red vapor now spouted
forth he judged that the creatures had got upon
their feet. Now he could see glowing sparks and
vivid jets of flame.</p>

<p>59. Suddenly as a streak of lightning, on came the
fiery animals, roaring like thunder and sending out
sheets of white flame. Most distinctly Jason saw
the two horrible creatures galloping right down
upon him, their brazen hoofs rattling and ringing
over the ground, and their tails sticking up stiffly
into the air, as has always been the fashion with
angry bulls.</p>

<p>60. Their breath scorched the herbage before them.
But as for Jason himself, thanks to Medea's enchanted
ointment, the white flame curled around his
body without injuring him a jot.</p>

<p>61. Greatly encouraged at finding himself not yet
turned into a cinder, the young man awaited the
attack of the bulls. Just as the brazen brutes fancied
themselves sure of tossing him into the air, he
caught one of them by the horn and the other by
his screwed-up tail, and held them in a grip like that
of an iron vise, one with his right hand, and the
other with his left. Well, he must have been wonderfully
strong in his arms, to be sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/illus229.jpg" width="459" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

<p>

</p>

<p>Jason and the Brazen Bulls</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>62. But the secret of the matter was that the brazen
bulls were enchanted creatures, and that Jason had
broken the spell of their fiery fierceness by his bold
way of handling them.</p>

<p>63. It was now easy to yoke the bulls and to harness
them to the plow, and by the time that the
moon was a quarter of her journey up the sky the
plowed field lay before him, a large tract of black
earth, ready to be sown with the dragon's teeth. So
Jason scattered them broadcast.</p>

<p>The moon was now high aloft in the heavens and
threw its bright beams over the plowed field, where
as yet there was nothing to be seen.</p>

<p>64. But by and by all over the field there was
something that glistened in the moonbeams like
sparkling drops of dew. These bright objects
sprouted higher, and proved to be the steel heads of
spears. Then there was a dazzling gleam from a
vast number of polished brass helmets, beneath
which, as they grew farther out of the soil, appeared
the dark and bearded visages of warriors
struggling to free themselves from the imprisoning
earth.</p>

<p>65. The first look that they gave at the upper
world was a glare of wrath and defiance. Next
were seen their bright breastplates; in every right
hand there was a sword or a spear, and on each left
arm a shield; and when this strange crop of warriors
had but half grown out of the earth, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
struggled&mdash;such was their impatience of restraint&mdash;and,
as it were, tore themselves up by the roots.</p>

<p>66. Wherever a dragon's tooth had fallen, there
stood a man armed for battle. They made a clangor
with their swords against their shields, and eyed
one another fiercely; for they had come into this
beautiful world, and into the peaceful moonlight,
full of rage and stormy passions, and ready to take
the life of every human brother, in recompense of
the boon of their own existence.</p>

<p>67. For a while the warriors stood flourishing
their weapons, clashing their swords against their
shields, and boiling over with the red-hot thirst
for battle. At last the front rank caught sight of
Jason, who, beholding the flash of so many weapons
in the moonlight, had thought it best to draw his
sword.</p>

<p>68. In a moment all the sons of the dragon's teeth
appeared to take Jason for an enemy; and crying
with one voice, "Guard the Golden Fleece!" they
ran at him with uplifted swords and protruded
spears. Jason knew that it would be impossible to
withstand this bloodthirsty battalion with his single
arm, but determined, since there was nothing better
to be done, to die as valiantly as if he himself had
sprung from a dragon's tooth.</p>

<p>69. Medea, however, bade him snatch up a stone
from the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Throw it among them quickly!" cried she. "It
is the only way to save yourself."</p>

<p>The armed men were now so nigh that Jason
could discern the fire flashing out of their enraged
eyes, when he let fly the stone, and saw it strike the
helmet of a tall warrior who was rushing upon him
with his blade aloft.</p>

<p>70. The stone glanced from this man's helmet to
the shield of his nearest comrade, and thence flew
right into the angry face of another, hitting him
smartly between the eyes.</p>

<p>Each of the three who had been struck by the
stone took it for granted that his next neighbor
had given him a blow; and instead of running any
farther towards Jason, they began a fight among
themselves.</p>

<p>71. The confusion spread through the host,
so that it seemed scarcely a moment before they
were all hacking, hewing, and stabbing at one
another.</p>

<p>In an incredibly short space of time&mdash;almost as
short, indeed, as it had taken them to grow up&mdash;all
of the heroes of the dragon's teeth were stretched
lifeless on the field.</p>

<p>And there was the end of the army that had
sprouted from the dragon's teeth. That fierce and
feverish fight was the only enjoyment which they
had tasted on this beautiful earth.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>72. Agreeably to Medea's advice, Jason went in
the morning to the palace of King &AElig;etes. Entering
the presence chamber, he stood at the foot of the
throne and made a low obeisance.</p>

<p>"Your eyes look heavy, Prince Jason," observed
the king; "you appear to have spent a sleepless
night. I hope you have been considering the matter
a little more wisely, and have concluded not to get
yourself scorched to a cinder in attempting to tame
my brazen-lunged bulls."</p>

<p>73. "That is already accomplished, may it please
your majesty," replied Jason. "The bulls have
been tamed and yoked; the field has been plowed;
the dragon's teeth have been sown broadcast and
harrowed into the soil; the crop of armed warriors
have sprung up, and they have slain one another to
the last man. And now I solicit your majesty's
permission to encounter the dragon, that I may take
down the Golden Fleece from the tree and depart
with my nine and forty comrades."</p>

<p>74. King &AElig;etes scowled and looked very angry
and greatly disturbed; for he knew that, in accordance
with his kingly promise, he ought now to
permit Jason to win the Fleece if his courage and
skill should enable him to do so.</p>

<p>75. "You never would have succeeded in this
business, young man," said he, "if my undutiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
daughter Medea had not helped you with her
enchantments. Had you acted fairly, you would
have been at this instant a black cinder or a
handful of white ashes. I forbid you, on pain of
death, to make any more attempts to get the
Golden Fleece. To speak my mind plainly, you
shall never set eyes on so much as one of its
glistening locks."</p>

<p>76. Jason left the king's presence in great sorrow
and anger. But, as he was hastening down
the palace steps, the Princess Medea called after
him and beckoned him to return.</p>

<p>"What says King &AElig;etes, my royal and upright
father?" inquired Medea, slightly smiling. "Will
he give you the Golden Fleece without any further
risk or trouble?"</p>

<p>77. "On the contrary," answered Jason, "he is
very angry with me for taming the brazen bulls
and sowing the dragon's teeth. And he forbids
me to make any more attempts, and positively
refuses to give up the Golden Fleece whether I
slay the dragon or no."</p>

<p>78. "Yes, Jason," said the princess, "and I can
tell you more. Unless you set sail from Colchis
before to-morrow's sunrise, the king means to
burn your fifty-oared galley and put yourself and
your forty-nine brave comrades to the sword. But
be of good courage. The Golden Fleece you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
shall have, if it lies within the power of my enchantments
to get it for you. Wait for me here
an hour before midnight."</p>

<p>79. At the appointed hour you might again have
seen Prince Jason and the Princess Medea, side
by side, stealing through the streets of Colchis, on
their way to the sacred grove, in the center of
which the Golden Fleece was suspended to a tree.</p>

<p>80. Jason followed Medea's guidance into the
Grove of Mars, where the great oak trees that
had been growing for centuries threw so thick a
shade that the moonbeams struggled vainly to
find their way through it. Only here and there
a glimmer fell upon the leaf-strewn earth, or now
and then a breeze stirred the boughs aside and
gave Jason a glimpse of the sky, lest, in that deep
obscurity, he might forget that there was one
overhead.</p>

<p>81. At length, when they had gone farther and
farther into the heart of the duskiness, Medea
squeezed Jason's hand.</p>

<p>"Look yonder," she whispered. "Do you see it?"</p>

<p>Gleaming among the venerable oaks there was a
radiance, not like the moonbeams, but rather resembling
the golden glory of the setting sun. It
proceeded from an object which appeared to be suspended
at about a man's height from the ground, a
little farther within the wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>82. "What is it?" asked Jason.</p>

<p>"Have you come so far to seek it," exclaimed
Medea, "and do you not recognize the meed of all
your toils and perils when it glitters before your
eyes? It is the Golden Fleece."</p>

<p>83. Jason went onward a few steps farther, and
then stopped to gaze. Oh, how beautiful it looked,
shining with a marvelous light of its own, that
prize which so many heroes had longed to behold,
but had perished in the quest of it either by the
perils of their voyage or by the fiery breath of the
brazen-lunged bulls!</p>

<p>84. "How gloriously it shines!" cried Jason, in a
rapture. "It has surely been dipped in the richest
gold of sunset. Let me hasten onward and take it
to my bosom."</p>

<p>"Stay," said Medea, holding him back. "Have
you forgotten what guards it?"</p>

<p>85. To say the truth, in the joy of beholding the
object of his desires, the terrible dragon had quite
slipped out of Jason's memory. Soon, however,
something came to pass that reminded him what
perils were still to be encountered.</p>

<p>86. An antelope, that probably mistook the yellow
radiance for sunrise, came bounding fleetly through
the grove. He was rushing straight towards the
Golden Fleece, when suddenly there was a frightful
hiss, and the immense head and half the scaly body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of the dragon were thrust forth&mdash;for he was twisted
round the trunk of the tree on which the Fleece
hung&mdash;and seizing the poor antelope, swallowed
him with one snap of his jaws.</p>

<p>87. The dragon had probably heard the voices;
for, swift as lightning, his black head and forked
tongue came hissing among the trees again, darting
full forty feet at a stretch. As it approached,
Medea tossed a magic potion right down the monster's
wide-open throat. Immediately, with an outrageous
hiss and a tremendous wriggle, flinging
his tail up to the tiptop of the tallest tree and shattering
all its branches as it crashed heavily down
again, the dragon fell at full length upon the
ground and lay quite motionless.</p>

<p>88. "It is only a sleeping potion," said the enchantress
to Prince Jason. "Quick! Snatch the prize and
let us begone. You have won the Golden Fleece."</p>

<p>Jason caught the Fleece from the tree and hurried
through the grove, the deep shadows of which were
illuminated, as he passed, by the golden glory of the
precious object that he bore along.</p>

<p>89. Jason found the heroes seated on the benches
of the galley, with their oars held perpendicularly,
ready to let fall into the water.</p>

<p>As he drew near, he heard the Talking Image
calling to him with more than ordinary eagerness
in its grave, sweet voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make haste, Prince Jason! For your life, make
haste!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/illus238.jpg" width="417" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>The galley flew over the water.</p></div>
</div>

<p>90. With one bound, he leaped aboard. At sight
of the glorious radiance of the
Golden Fleece, the nine and forty
heroes gave a mighty shout, and
Orpheus, striking his harp, sang
a song of triumph, to the cadence
of which the galley flew over the
water, homeward bound, as if
careering along with wings.</p>

<h2>The Star-Spangled Banner</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Francis Scott Key</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Francis Scott Key (1780-1843): An American lawyer,
who will be remembered as the author of "The Star-Spangled
Banner."</p>

<p>During the second war with England, in 1814, the British
made an attack upon the city of Baltimore. The British
war ships moved up near Fort McHenry and opened a heavy
fire of cannon balls, bomb shells, and rockets. These latter
were made like our well-known sky rockets, and could be
thrown at the enemy.</p>

<p>During the battle some Americans, one of whom was
Francis Scott Key, carried a flag of truce out to the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
fleet to secure the release of an American citizen who had
been taken prisoner. The Americans were detained over
night on a ship far to the rear of the attack. During the
night they listened anxiously to the sound of the guns, and
watched the red rockets and the bursting bombs, being sure
that, as long as the firing continued, the fort still held out;
but late in the night the guns became silent. Did it mean
that the attack had been repulsed? Or had the fort surrendered?
Only daylight would tell.</p>

<p>Before dawn the anxious Americans were watching. The
first faint light of day showed them the stars and stripes still
floating over the fort; then they knew that the attack had
failed and that the Americans were victorious.</p>

<p>While on the deck of the British war ship, Mr. Key composed
the poem which has become our national anthem.</p></div>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt (1858 &mdash;&mdash;): The twenty-sixth President

<h3>I</h3>

<p>1. That evening we almost had a visit from one
of the animals we were after. Several times we
had heard at night the musical calling of the bull
elk&mdash;a sound to which no writer has
as yet done justice.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus244.jpg" width="700" height="531" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>A grizzly bear</p></div>
</div>

<p>2. This particular night, when
we were in bed and the fire was
smoldering, we were roused by a
ruder noise&mdash;a kind of grunting
or roaring whine, answered
by the frightened
snorts of the ponies. It was a bear which had
evidently not seen the fire, as it came from behind
the bank, and had probably been attracted by the
smell of the horses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>
<p>3. After it made out what we were, it stayed
round a short while, again uttered its peculiar roaring
grunt and went off. We had seized our rifles and
had run out into the woods, but in the darkness
could see nothing; indeed, it was rather lucky we
did not stumble across the bear, as he could have
made short work of us when we were at such a
disadvantage.</p>

<p>4. Next day we went off on a long tramp through
the woods and along the sides of the canyons. There
were plenty of berry bushes growing in clusters,
and all around these there were fresh tracks of bear.
But the grizzly is also a flesh-eater, and has a great
liking for carrion.</p>

<p>5. On visiting the place where Merrifield had
killed the black bear, we found that the grizzlies
had been there before us, and had utterly devoured
the carcass, with cannibal relish. Hardly a scrap
was left, and we turned our steps toward where lay
the bull elk I had killed.</p>

<p>6. It was quite late in the afternoon when we
reached the place. A grizzly had evidently been at
the carcass during the preceding night, for his great
footprints were in the ground all around it, and the
carcass itself was gnawed and torn and partially
covered with earth and leaves; for the grizzly has
a curious habit of burying all of his prey that he
does not at the moment need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/illus246.jpg" width="700" height="633" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>We sat still to wait.</p></div>
</div>

<p>7. A great many ravens had been
feeding on the body, and they wheeled
about over the tree tops above us, uttering
their barking croaks.</p>

<p>8. The forest was composed mainly of what are
called ridge-pole pines, which grow close together,
and do not branch out until the stems are thirty or
forty feet from the ground. Beneath these trees
we walked over a carpet of pine needles, upon
which our moccasined feet made no sound. The
woods seemed vast and lonely, and their silence was
broken now and then by the strange noises always
to be heard in the great forests, and which seem to
mark the sad and everlasting unrest of the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>9. We climbed up along the trunk of a dead tree
which had toppled over until its upper branches
stuck in the limb crotch of another, that thus supported
it at an angle half-way in its fall. When above
the ground far enough to prevent the bear's smelling
us, we sat still to wait for his approach until, in
the gathering gloom, we could no longer see the
sights of our rifles, and could but dimly make out
the carcass of the great elk.</p>

<p>10. It was useless to wait longer, and we clambered
down, and stole out to the edge of the woods.
The forest here covered one side of a steep, almost
canyon-like ravine, whose other side was bare, except
of rock and sage brush. Once out from under the
trees there was still plenty of light, although the
sun had set, and we crossed over some fifty yards
to the opposite hillside and crouched down under a
bush to see if perchance some animal might not also
leave the cover.</p>

<p>11. To our right the ravine sloped downward
toward the valley of the Bighorn River, and far on
its other side we could catch a glimpse of the great
main chain of the Rockies, their snow peaks glinting
crimson in the light of the set sun.</p>

<p>12. Again we waited quietly in the growing dusk,
until the pine trees in our front blended into one
dark, frowning mass. We saw nothing; but the
wild creatures of the forest had begun to stir abroad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
The owls hooted dismally from the tops of the tall
trees, and two or three times a harsh, wailing cry,
probably the voice of some lynx or wolverine, arose
from the depths of the woods.</p>

<p>13. At last, as we were rising to leave, we heard
the sound of the breaking of a dead stick from the
spot where we knew the carcass lay. It was a
sharp, sudden noise, perfectly distinct from the
natural creaking and snapping of the branches; just
such a sound as would be made by the tread of
some heavy creature. "Old Ephraim" had come
back to the carcass.</p>

<p>14. A minute afterward, listening with strained
ears, we heard him brush by some dry twigs. It
was entirely too dark to go in after him; but we
made up our minds that on the morrow he should
be ours.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>15. Early the next morning we were over at the
elk carcass, and, as we expected, found that the
bear had eaten his fill at it during the night. His
tracks showed him to be an immense fellow, and
were so fresh that we doubted if he had left long
before we arrived; and we made up our minds to
follow him up and try to find his lair.</p>

<p>16. My companion was a skillful tracker, and we
took up the trail at once. For some distance it led
over the soft, yielding carpet of moss and pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
needles, and the footprints were quite easily made
out, although we could follow them but slowly; for
we had, of course, to keep a sharp lookout ahead
and around us as we walked noiselessly on in the
somber half light always prevailing under the great
pine trees.</p>

<p>17. We made no sound ourselves, and every little
sudden noise sent a thrill through me as I peered
about, with each sense on the alert. Two or three
of the ravens that we had scared from the carcass
flew overhead, croaking hoarsely; and the pine tops
moaned and sighed in the slight breeze&mdash;for pine
trees seem to be ever in motion, no matter how light
the wind.</p>

<p>18. After going a few hundred yards the tracks
turned off on a well-beaten path made by the elk;
the woods were in many places cut up by these
game trails, which had often become as distinct as
ordinary footpaths. The beast's footprints were
perfectly plain in the dust, and he had lumbered
along up the path until near the middle of the hillside,
where the ground broke away and there were
hollows and bowlders.</p>

<p>19. Here there had been a windfall, and the dead
trees lay among the living, piled across one another
in all directions; while between and around them
sprouted up a thick growth of young spruces and
other evergreens. The trail turned off into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
tangled thicket, within which it was almost certain
we would find our quarry.</p>

<p>20. We could still follow the tracks, by the slight
scrapes of the claws on the bark, or by the bent and
broken twigs; and we advanced with noiseless caution,
slowly climbing over the dead tree trunks and
upturned stumps, and not letting a branch rustle or
catch on our clothes. When in the middle of the
thicket, we crossed what was almost a breastwork of
fallen logs, and Merrifield, who was leading, passed
by the upright stem of a great pine.</p>

<p>21. As soon as he was by it he sank suddenly on
one knee, turning half round, his face fairly aflame
with excitement; and as I strode past him, with
my rifle at the ready, there, not ten steps off, was
the great bear, slowly rising from his bed among
the young spruces. He had heard us, but apparently
hardly knew exactly where or what we were,
for he reared up on his haunches, sideways to us.</p>

<p>22. Then he saw us and dropped down again on
all fours, the shaggy hair on his neck and shoulders
seeming to bristle as he turned toward us.
As he sank down on his fore feet I had raised the
rifle; his head was bent slightly down, and when I
saw the top of the white bead fairly between his
small, glittering, evil eyes, I pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>23. Half rising up, the huge beast fell over on his
side in the death throes, the ball having gone into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
his brain, striking as fairly between the eyes as
if the distance had been measured by a carpenter's
rule.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/illus251.jpg" width="550" height="446" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>He reared up on his haunches.</p></div>
</div>

<p>24. The whole thing was over in twenty seconds
from the time I caught sight of the game; indeed,
it was over so quickly that the grizzly did not have
time to show fight at all, or come a step toward
us. It was the first I had ever seen, and I felt not
a little proud as I stood over the great brindled
bulk which lay stretched out at length in the cool
shade of the evergreens.</p>

<p>25. He was a monstrous fellow, much larger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
any I have seen since, whether alive or brought in
dead by the hunters. As near as we could estimate&mdash;for
of course we had nothing with which to
weigh more than very small portions&mdash;he must
have weighed about twelve hundred pounds; and
though this is not so large as some of his kind are
said to grow in California, it is yet a very unusual
size for a bear. He was a good deal heavier than
any of our horses; and it was with the greatest
difficulty that we were able to skin him.</p>

<p>26. He must have been very old, his teeth and
claws being all worn down and blunted; but
nevertheless he had been living in plenty, for he
was as fat as a prize hog, the layers of his back
being a finger's length in thickness.</p>

<p>27. He was still in the summer coat, his hair
being short, and in color a curious brindled brown,
somewhat like that of certain bulldogs; while all
the bears we shot afterward had the long, thick
winter fur, cinnamon or yellowish brown.</p>

<p>28. By the way, the name of this bear has reference
to its character and not to its color, and should,
I suppose, be properly spelled "grisly"&mdash;in the sense
of horrible, exactly as we speak of a "grisly
specter"&mdash;and not "grizzly;" but perhaps the latter
way of spelling it is too well established to be now
changed.</p>
